Interstellar,"Track 14 - Detach5:30, is the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever heard"
Interstellar,Just finished watching it loved it too 5 very long but so so so good
Interstellar,Almost every single human I have personally met hates this movie.My family hated it. My wife hated it. My friends hated it. My in-laws hated it. Every random person I‚Äôve ever talked to about movies? Hated it. I cannot think of any movie I‚Äôve seen that is collectively disliked by so many I‚Äôve met.And thenI see the high rating on Letterboxd. Wtaf? Is this a psy-op? Is big sci-fi lying about how good this movie is? Do‚Ä¶
Interstellar,"I find that I am often intrigued by this genre(?) of science-fiction realism where the mathematical and probable outcome is possible, if far-fetched. There is an entertaining display of thought-provoking ideas and concepts though I felt nothing more. The reliance on finding an answer to Cooper‚Äôs expedition could not pass through to resonate with my emotions and I desperatelywantedto care. For as lovely and beautiful as the visuals and soundtrack are, I would rather watch an episode of NOVA or visit a planetarium."
Interstellar,"Franchement ok le film est g√©nial, il est beau, les th√®mes abord√©s sont plut√¥t int√©ressantes mais faut ce l‚Äôavouer qu‚Äôau fur et √† mesure du temps, les gens abusent du film comme quoi c‚Äôest meilleur film de toute la d√©cennie alors que nan il y a plusieurs film qui sont bien meilleurs que Interstellar. Je dis pas que je n‚Äôaime pas et la preuve sur ma note mais stop c‚Äôest pas le film du si√®cle."
Interstellar,Honestly it's imperfect but it's a favorite for me... It just resonates
Interstellar,"Perfect, I've never seen a movie address quantum mechanics in such a faithful way, and despite all the scientific discussion it still has a ""simple"" meaning: love between father and daughter. I repeat, perfect movie."
Interstellar,"Never gets old, hoe vaak ik het ook zie"
Interstellar,This movie is so good I would give it a MILLION stars. The plot twist during the movie was crazy to me and I didn‚Äôt expect it at ALL. Honestly the soundtrack was amazing and the concept of space and wormholes was so cool. It was was also very very sad I cried while watching‚òπÔ∏è anyway I loved Murph btw she was so intelligent. Cooper and TARS were so funny. This movie also made me realize that time is truly just a concept and it really isn‚Äôt as long as we think. Overall so good
Interstellar,SOU APAIXONADA ESSE FILME √â INCR√çVEL TIPO TODOS DEVERIAM ASSISTIR UMA VEZ NA VIDA PELO MENOS UM ABSURDO DE BOMMM
Interstellar,Second watch was exponentially better than the first.
The Dark Knight,So the man that freaked me out and had me at the edge of my seat is Patrick Verona!!?!??
The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance is potentially one of the greatest of all time. Mix it in with great special effects, twists and turns, grit and action, and I think you might have a perfect movie."
The Dark Knight,"Truly a great movie. So well directed and the story is very good, too. The opening sequence is perhaps the best made heist in film history. Not as complex as an Ocean's 11 or Inside Man, but so perfectly executed, right down to the mask reference to The Killing."
The Dark Knight,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunityTo seize everything you ever wanted in one momentWould you capture it or just let it slip?"
The Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan‚Äôs The Dark Knight is a cinematic triumph that transcends the superhero genre. From its gripping narrative to its jaw-dropping performances, this film is a work of art that redefines the superhero movie.Christian Bale‚Äôs portrayal of Batman is as intense and layered as ever, but it is Heath Ledger‚Äôs iconic performance as the Joker that elevates this film to legendary status. His chilling, anarchic energy dominates every scene, creating one of the most memorable villains in movie history.‚Ä¶"
The Dark Knight,hate batman in this but every scene with joker heath ledger and maggie gyllenhaal saved it
The Dark Knight,F√∏ler folk ikke snakker nok om Aaron Eckhart i denne filmenMannen spiser opp hver scene han er i jo
The Dark Knight,"heath ledger's performance as the joker is so phenomenal, i legit just could not look away."

The Dark Knight,"‚ÄúSuperhero movie‚Äù is probably one of my least favorite genres out there, to be honest. Was never really a fan of DC nor Marvel. The Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy is perhaps the only exception. Until now.The Dark Knight was fantastic. It unexpectedly surpassed my expectations, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I thought that Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker was gonna be the only good thing this movie has to offer, but jesus, the whole movie was just so good."
The Dark Knight,28th April be with you happy superhero day the greatest superhero of all the time goatmanRagnar o batman 3mkom
The Dark Knight,"simplesmente uma obra prima. com diversas cenas memor√°veis, o melhor vil√£o de todos os filmes e atua√ß√µes perfeitas, esse filme se consagra como o melhor desse g√™nero de her√≥is. acho genial a origem do duas caras, nunca pensei que um vil√£o que antes eu considerava secund√°rio poderia ser t√£o foda."
The Dark Knight,minus a half star because they missed the opportunity for the joker to say ‚Äúyou wanna know how i got these bars?‚Äù and engage in a rap battle with batman
The Dark Knight,"One of the best movies of the DC universe, Christopher Nolan is a genius."
The Dark Knight,forever one of my favourite films ever. a masterpiece in every way. rip heath ledger you king

The Dark Knight,One of my favorite movies of all time so I am happy to finally review it on this app.It had been a few years since I had watched this movie in its entirety. I used to watch the joker scenes repeatedly on YouTube and I think that made me view the movie as more disconnected in the past. It was nice to watch it all again and see how ‚Äúahead of the curve‚Äù the joker was the entire time.‚Ä¶
The Dark Knight,How did harvey dent not know it was the joker until he took off his face mask
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight as a complete film was not as incredible as Heath Ledger was by himself. The movie didn‚Äôt allow enough time for certain scenes to breathe and didn‚Äôt feel as complete as Batman Begins did. With that being said I have it on par with Batman Begins because Ledger‚Äôs joker was utter perfection.
The Dark Knight,best adaption of batman and the joker FIGHT ME
The Dark Knight,loveeee this one! amazing villains
The Dark Knight,I‚Äôd smash majority of the men in this except for harvey EW
Inception,"Did not fully understand what was going on when I first watched it in the cinema, but now I get it‚Ä¶ what a great movie!"
Inception,"Finally I can partake in the discussion. I presume most enjoy Nolan‚Äôs passion with dimensions, time, and the space that he incorporates into his stories. That in my opinion is the most pure representation of his signature or fingerprint in a film. Personally what has accumulated to compel me to discuss Nolan in conversations and my personal headspace as a talented director is his visual effects with physics.Visually Inception is stunning. I am not a movie buff, but the creative‚Ä¶"

Inception,what if we're all NPCs inside another person's dream
Inception,Gotta be one of my favorite movies
Inception,"oh good, now im scared leo dicaprio will manipulate me thru my dreamsüò®"
Inception,"Per molti un cult e forse lo √®; l'incipit √® notevolissimo e Nolan sa giostrarlo benone, grazie a un buon cast (bravo Di Caprio), ottima regia e perfetta gestione di effetti speciali ""vecchia scuola"". Di contro, la carne al fuoco √® troppa e i bersagli vengono a mancare, soprattutto in un terzo atto troppo lungo e confusionario. Nel complesso, un prodotto di gran fattura, che merita il plauso di molti, ma i capolavori sono altri."
Inception,"stop right now. i was screaming ‚ÄúFALL FALL FALL BITCH FALL‚Äù at the end i‚Äôm not even kidding.i get that the point of the last scene is that cobb doesn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs reunited with his children and thats all he wanted, but i can‚Äôt help feeling disappointed that if it really is a dream, cobb is okay with leaving his real children in reality and living with projections instead. that is why i choose to believe he's in reality, that he escaped the dream, and that he is with his real children at last."

Lord of War,"It‚Äôs true, a gun never killed anybody.‚Ä¶ we should blame the individual that aimed and pulled the trigger.It‚Äôs also true that without constant death, the market for guns would be obsolete.thoughts and prayersdon‚Äôt mean anything when the industry continues to arm evil individuals, and financially corrupt politicians.

Lord of War,my beloved ethan hawke is goated
Lord of War,The pacing was a little off and a lot of the dialogue felt stunted but overall good movie. Having Cage be an unreliable narrator was a very good move. Ending felt rushed (probably not intentional) and dissatisfying (definitely intentional). It especially stings since the real guy Cage‚Äôs character is based on got released in a prisoner swap for WNBA legend Brittney Griner. At least Jared Leto died in it.
Lord of War,very prototypical 2000s stimmy realistic fiction movie
Lord of War,"This movie was so uninteresting to me that i got halfway through before i realized i had already watched it a few years ago. the movie is so blandly nihilistic that it can't even fully commit to its own brand of self-important nihilism. felt like trying to chew through cardboard. half a star because some of the individual scenes character moments were, i guess, creative."
Lord of War,Thought this was a bio pic at first so that made it super cool and much more tense. A little cliche at times but alas cause it rules
Lord of War,I noticed that some of the characters Donny seem to age over 20 years.

Lord of War,i wouldve been a crazy weapons merchant
Lord of War,A movie I liked more than I thought I would. It‚Äôs a movie about Yuri‚Äôs descent into dehumanization before he regains a consciousness of sorts and feels the gravity of the situation he put himself within. A film that captivated me from start to finish; I found that I was more invested in Yuri‚Äôs character growth and what would happen to him than a lot of other characters in a moral grey realm like him. It‚Äôs a fantastically real story‚Ä¶
Lord of War,"too many one liners to choose from, fuck ethan hawke little nerd"
Lord of War,"A very Scorsese-esque movie here and one that I actually liked at that: maybe a little too reverent at times, but I use that comparison favourably for the most part; Nic Cage also puts in one of his more understated and as a result, better performances here aswell and writer-director Andrew Niccol spins a brilliant cautionary tale on the weapons trade despite how some of his characters (though developed fairly well) might only serve as a mouthpiece for his message in this movie. As a whole, however, it's good, solid filmmaking with a noble story to tell."
Lord of War,"Great editing and camera work, underwhelming narrative.The film stuffs so much plot in it‚Äôs 122 minute runtime that there is no room to for proper characterization and theme development. Both aspects of the film remain flat and cartoonish.Juri‚Äôs wife is an idealized princess straight out of a disney film. His brother is a one trick pony who‚Äôs constantly coked out and horny, until the plot forces him to become a martyr. Juri‚Äòs parents are props, used to verbalize‚Ä¶"
Lord of War,"i could tell you the plot from the first 5 minutes, but dtill good"
Lord of War,One of my comfort movies I think? First time seeing it on the 4K disc.

The Zone of Interest,"This is not grim enough for a movie about the holocaust, yet it is so very grim. Felt like a horror movie about a real life monster"
The Zone of Interest,Shows the horrors in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù family setting. What was even most unsettling was watching this movie after being to Auschwitz and seeing the horrors committed and where H√∂ss‚Äôs house would‚Äôve been and knowing he would‚Äôve seen the atrocities. Insane but very well made
The Zone of Interest,extremely effective film. trusting that the audience can keep up. i've seen people call it 'horrific in its mundanity' since it premiered and. yep.

The Zone of Interest,"Chilling, suffocating, and brutally restrained ‚Äî The Zone of Interest is a masterclass in showing horror without showing it. Glazer‚Äôs detached, almost clinical approach makes the evil feel even more monstrous, embedding it into the everyday rhythms of a ""normal"" life. The sound design does half the heavy lifting, and it‚Äôs terrifying in ways that visuals could never achieve. Christian Friedel and Sandra H√ºller are hauntingly ordinary, which is exactly the point. It‚Äôs not an easy watch, but it‚Äôs essential, and it lingers long after the credits roll like a sickness you can‚Äôt shake."
The Zone of Interest,this dude used to makesexy beastso i feel like that tells you something about howyou‚Äôremeant to be feeling walking around every day
The Zone of Interest,"this is a horror movie. And I completely get why they gave it the Best Sound Academy Award, sounds in the movie are so crucial and so disturbing that makes you focus that we are thinking about what's on the orher side of the wall. Its one of the best movies I've seen, and its as terrifying and horrible as its majestic. Pretty relevant to see how there are other zones of interest in the present day."

Moneyball,EVERY TIME. Oh my gosh this movie is the most heartwarming story every and I watched on a plane this time.
Moneyball,"Wish this movie would've been confident enough in itself to stay focused on what's interesting here: the GM's career, his evolving strategy, his relationship with the team, the tensions he holds between data science + superstition, the little weirdo Jonah Hill plays, It really didn't need all the extra fluff about his past and his family.

The Last of the Mohicans,"This was discussed on the most recent episode of the Video Archives podcast, which got me intrigued to see this. I‚Äôve never seen any adaptation of this material before. This is the 1936 version, starring Randolph Scott as Hawkeye.This film has everything: fully realized characters, who I was totally invested in, several competing factions, all with their reasons, a great depiction (both positively and negatively) of military codes of honor and duty and lots and lots of action."
The Last of the Mohicans,"If I didn't fell in love with the Mann version years ago, this could be my favourite ""the last of the mohicans"" picture. They made a bunch of them since the silent era. This one, class 1936, holds the test of time, except for the deaths by firearm that are kind of silly, but having say that what a gorgeous film that Seitz pull out of this ever green story. Randalph Scott as Hawkeye gives han solo vibes to his‚Ä¶"
The Last of the Mohicans,Watched due to the Video Archives Podcast.
The Last of the Mohicans,"Although not the first on-screen adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's iconic 1826 novel, its clear that many of the future tellings of this tale owe a great deal to this George B. Seitz work, which features a younger Randolph Scott as the central Hawkeye, a scout who is tasked with escorting two daughters of Colonel Monroe safely through the brutal French and Native American War.A leaner, more adventurous take on the story than many of the other cinematic adaptions,‚Ä¶"
The Last of the Mohicans,"Yes, I listened to Tarantinos podcast where he gushes about this movie but I was extremely skeptical.I also have not seen the Michael Mann version yet, but this was quite good!Worse part was watching it on plex, horrendous commercials completely took me out of it.Also Randolph Scotts hair style is so bizarre"
The Last of the Mohicans,"Randolph Scott isn't Daniel Day-Lewis, but he is still Randolph Scott. The man's endlessly watchable. The film felt a lot longer than the runtime suggested. It's rather slow and flat in its delivery way more than it needs to be."
The Last of the Mohicans,"Yes I realize I rated this higher than the Mann version, and yes it‚Äôs not better, but I need to rewatch it first."
The Last of the Mohicans,It‚Äôs so violent and it moves so fast. However if you've seen the Michael Manm version you will constantly be comparing it. Randolph Scott is pretty good but he‚Äôs dressed like Davy Crocket.
The Last of the Mohicans,this is marginally better than the 1992 version like that one was just so bad
The Last of the Mohicans,"Sequence perang nya nice, sama ada adegan loncat bunuh diri dari tebing itu jarang banget di film western yg pernah w tonton jadi lumayan shocking. Ending nya potensial bleak (Hawkeye dibakar sebagai ganti squawk bebas) tapi malah jadi payah üôÑ kayak momen nya udah di bangun bleak lah ending nya digampangin gitu, mood rusak banget kawan, padahal bisa jadi film romance tragedy aja. Terus apa yg terjadi dengan emosi bapak yg anak dan kekasihnya yg ikutan loncat tebing itu, halach ga di up sama writer nya payah emang. Kayak target filmnya tuh harus dibikin balance"
The Last of the Mohicans,"I found director George Seitz and editor Harry Marker continually undercutting what few good scenes there are, the Fort Henry attack, the dramatic cliff deaths,Duncan‚Äòs heroic gambit, old native women mutilatingHawkeyesgenitalia, very frustrating for a film I was trying desperately to lock in to. (Note: all of those happen in the last 30 minutes of the film)Clearly I‚Äôm not as taken with this story as others.*Randy Scott‚Äôs long wavy hair is sexy asfuck.**Skinny Bruce Cabot asMaguain a Mohawk bald cap, less so."
The Last of the Mohicans,Thanks to the Video Archives Podcast for the recommendation.
The Last of the Mohicans,"Pulpy with lots of action, but white Randolph Scott's Hawkeye leads the charge through fights and chases. The fight choreography is rudimentary, the film maintains a consistent level of energy."
The Last of the Mohicans,"1st Movie in the Video Archives episode where American frontier adventure is definitely a theme.The other two, Northwest Passage and Kit Carson, were both decent as was this version of Last of the Mohicans.I do love the story but the lighting is strange and of course the camera framing is old fashioned and there are several blue-eyed Indians.But it was decent. This is the first Video Archives episode where I do not have a clear favourite.All OK."
The Last of the Mohicans,Will the real Hawkeye please stand up?
The Last of the Mohicans,i didn‚Äôt want the mohicans to end.
The Last of the Mohicans,Watching anyone in this films acting as they get shot is pure comedy.

The Last of the Mohicans,"Breezy, if somewhat unremarkable adaptation of the classic novel."
The Last of the Mohicans,"I read Jane Austen‚Äôs Persuasion in college, and I don‚Äôt remember much, but the protagonist‚Äôs father has always stuck with me. A pathetic character who preferred to immerse himself in the past rather than face the reality of his present. Anyway, I‚Äôve been really digging old movies recently for some reason."
The Last of the Mohicans,A relentless entertainment machine.
The Last of the Mohicans,"This pleasantly surprised me. Initially, I had reservations about the casting choices, as the two main actors seemed too similar. However, as the story unfolded, I realized that this was actually a clever decision. The plot captivated me from start to finish, and I was particularly drawn to the breathtaking cliff-top scene, which evoked memories of the classic film ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" While the acting didn't reach extraordinary heights, it still held its own. I couldn't help‚Ä¶"

Sicario,"really amazing visual pieces, a must-watch for anyone interested in adolescent coming-of-age narratives that embrace the masculine perspective.for young boys who don‚Äôt get to know anything else, life is crime - life is sex - life is hard fought.in a lot of ways i think this films does its best to hammer in this isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs supposed to be admired by young men, but it‚Äôs what becomes engrained after tons of exposure and exploitation.the scenes in prison‚Ä¶"

The Game,"By the end of the movie, you just want some kind of consequence for Van Orten, but the ending really says that this is just how life is for the wealthy; there are no consequences because you have the ultimate get out of jail free card.

The Game,"The middle third is so good, but it just didn't have the juice to finish the job. You approach the end and realize that there really wasn't many ways this could end, which reduces the tension and really makes you think about how it's just about a bunch of rich people spending stupid amounts of money to trick each other"
The Game,The Clown/TV scene is absolutely horrifying and I wish it kept more of that nightmarish and lonesome energy throughout.Very experimental by Fincher to just keep adding third act after third act after third act.
The Game,"My brain just got purple nurpled for 2 hours straight, and you think it would get used to the twists after 30 minutes and then BAM another one. This movie reminds me of Vanilla Sky in that you never know when you are in the game or not. Now I will constantly contemplate if I‚Äôm playing the game.

The Game,It‚Äôs a Wonderful Lifefor sickos
The Game,"This is the type of movie you can literally only watch once just based on the rug pull aspect of it. Not the greatest pull tho because the main character just lacks character and not the craziest suprise like nothing profound came of it as a viewer, good suspense like SAW vibes but no payoff"
The Game,Brilliant ending. The foreshadowing was crazy. Definitely keeps you guessing.
The Game,That dog has a fire pair of shoes now
The Game,"Great film as usual from Fincher.The acting from Michael Douglas is on another level. The build up is fantastic. But the ending threw me off. I would've preferred the tragic outcome before the final twist to be the defined ending. It felt too happy like. Everything else was great in other than that. It was definitely up there with ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" for me to a point. Also, I couldn't help but notice that this film‚Ä¶"
The Game,"It's just a prank bro, chillax."
The Game,i think the brother is the one who needs help- a man can be rich and boring if he wants at least he‚Äôs not a psychopath?
The Game,i realized i‚Äôve seen this movie before. during the last scene.
The Game,"Still fire, pace is a bit slow in 1st act, but the acting and direction are great and the story is original."
The Game,"This is just so stupid, the ending especially."
The Game,"This movie feels like one big prank once you reach the conclusion, but until then you‚Äôre sitting on the edge of your seat trying to process everything that‚Äôs happening. This deserves another watch in the future."
The Game,"I want this for my 48th birthday.Dude there‚Äôs movies you watch with some people and they say ‚Äòwhat is happening?‚Äô every other scene even when it‚Äôs like the movie is explaining things and going slow, and those people just don‚Äôt get it, somehow. I was watching this movie asking what is happening non stop, I was screaming. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any step of this movie that truly makes sense to me. I love it. The end of this‚Ä¶"

Toy Story 4,"Unnecessary, unexpected but it‚Äôs good"
Toy Story 4,"Such a hard film to rate considering the context behind it. I don‚Äôt think this is an unnecessary sequel because it‚Äôs a cash-grab. The story has meaning in it. My problem comes to how this undermines the conclusion of three. The arc that spanned 1 through 3 was wrapped up beautifully. This opens that arc back up which doesn‚Äôt feel necessary. However, I do think the story opens the book of these characters once last time to give a massive‚Ä¶"
Toy Story 4,I didn‚Äôt think this movie was necessary because the 3rd movie was a perfect way to end the franchise. Seeing how Hollywood/Disney/Pixar can‚Äôt come up with original movies anymore these days they keep making these movies. It was interesting seeing how Woody transitioned from being Andy‚Äôs toy to Bonnie‚Äôs to living out in the streets with Bo Peep. He was made to be Andy‚Äôs toy I feel. He didn‚Äôt quite fit with Bonnie and I think that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt really get played with a lot. I‚Äôm glad he found Bo and found a new purpose in his life.
Toy Story 4,they NEEDED to show that they improved in animation since ‚Äò95 i guess
Toy Story 4,"Totalmente negada a verla pero despues de 6 a√±os de su salida ced√≠.

Toy Story 4,So remember when Pixar made the perfect ending to one of the greatest trilogies of all time in Toy Story 3 and then they decided hey we need more money so they made this shit
Toy Story 4,woody really chose a girl from 9 years ago over all his friends
Toy Story 4,This is pretty much tied for me for best Toy Story movie. The story from the third is the best one but this is the funniest one for sure. The plush rush scene is such a funny scene. I thought some of the new characters were fun. Duke Kaboom was also a highlight. Rijon! So good every time. Also I loved Buzz and his ‚Äúinner conscience‚Äù‚Ä¶ cheesy but great. I am not a huge fan of how woody leaves at‚Ä¶
Toy Story 4,Fokin woody simp4/10 la animaci√≥n es sine
Toy Story 4,my life being a Forky average experiencey a Pierre Niney dans le film #cl√©liareference
Toy Story 4,"i really liked this one! Woody's character specifically, i think the thing that got me is that he is actually playing the role of the 'movie cowboy' and the plot kind of follows in that way with the kid he has to protect, old flame, sacrifice, saying your goodbyes. I think it was really well handled and I also really like the villain redemption. Just a very good time and visually looked amazing especially with lighting that at times felt kind of like James Mangold dramatic"
Toy Story 4,"Analisando racionalmente esse filme t√° longe de ser ruim, mas eu odeio o fato de terem inventado essa sequ√™ncia desnecess√°ria s√≥ pelo dinheiro, tirando todo o peso do final do terceiro filme e ainda introduzir personagens irrelevantes puramente pelo merchandise. Espero que Toy Story 5 seja o pior filme j√° feito pela Pixar para que talvez eles percebam que √© melhor parar."
Toy Story 4,"Bagaimana caranya membuat sebuah sekuel dari cerita yang sudah memiliki the perfect closure? Jawabannya: Toy Story 4. Awalnya saya kira Disney sedang praktek ilmu kapitalisme saja dengan mengeksploitasi sebuah IP yang semestinya sudah diistirahatkan dengan tenang, tapi saat menyaksikan filmnya, saya terkejut. Film ini berhasil mengeskplorasi sebuah character arc yang saya tidak pernah kira musti diakhiri, tapi ternyata... musti.Saya kira film ini akan bercerita tentang itu, tapi ternyata bukan tentang itu, dan saya belum pernah merasa begitu senang ditipu film seperti ini sebelumnya. Toy Story 4 ternyata benar-benar sebuah penutup yang indah dan semestinya."
Toy Story 4,Toy story is my favourite trilogy

The Last King of Scotland,This was disturbing but in the non fiction wayLowkey I was sniffing out gay allegations in the first half‚Ä¶. That did stop after a few events tho.This poor doctor just wanted a career and he was helping so many people until he decided to work for the president. This movie also had nothing to do with Scotland but was also inspired by true events.So sorry to any doctor that had to go through thatOther than that I love the Ugandan accents and culture except for the invisible shirts.
The Last King of Scotland,Esta pel√≠cula es bastante buena demostrando la situaci√≥n en ese tiempo y la actualizaci√≥n de Whittaker es incre√≠ble
The Last King of Scotland,A lil bit less of american accion and it would‚Äôve been 5 out of 5.
The Last King of Scotland,Not for the faint-hearted. Jesus Christ! Enter at own risk.

The Last King of Scotland,"No es solo la actuaci√≥n de Forest lo que hace especial a esta pel√≠cula sino el hecho de que sea real, cuantas horribles dictaduras habr√°n sido ignoradas por la humanidad. Esta es la maravilla de el cine, hay que agradecer a Forest Whitanker por traer a la vida un personaje tan controversial y a Macdonald, su director por presentar el gobierno de Idi Amin como lo que fue, una dictadura.Las pel√≠culas basadas en hechos hist√≥ricos, en mi opini√≥n, son importantes y excelentes, pues se atreven a contar la verdad, puntos de vista y a informar, que para m√≠ es lo esencial ac√°.Gran peliculaaa"

John Wick,This was fun and entertaining the entire way through but I am admittedly not a huge fan of the genre/these archetypes of movies. Big takeaway is don‚Äôt fuck with John Wick‚Äôs dog
John Wick,esse filme lembra mt gta online e s√≥ por isso vale 2 estrelas
John Wick,faria tudo isso e mais pelos meus cachorros e gatos tbm
John Wick,I‚Äôd also crash out and kill everyone if my wife and dog died in the same week.
John Wick,dead wife core is a powerful thing

John Wick,"The good: Keanu Reeves as the Grim Reaper, the dog, the stupefying gunfight sequences, the random cameos form acting legendsThe bad: Dialogue, color grading (dull, drab, lifeless), cinematography (amateur hour)The ugly: the Russian accents. TERRIBLE. SO UNNECESSARY.2.5/5"

John Wick,"Most realistic but still fun action movie, one of the few perfect action movies."
John Wick,"Pros h√©teros deve ser um filma√ßo. Pra mim foi camp. E foi divertido, n√£o √© ruim."
The Matrix,"They say no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself..I would argue that had I been blind, my comprehension via braille would've been equally sufficient to grok the narrative's demands, more so than my initial viewing that included all of my senses, including smell."
The Matrix,"o filme √© √≥timo, porem poderia ser mais completo. deixou o final muito aberto, n√£o sei se tem uma continua√ß√£o ou n√£o, mas irei procurar mais tarde.Tem muita coisa maneirissima como os agentes da matrix, a pr√≥pria ideia dos que sa√≠ram dela e fazerem um servidor pirata pra tirar outra rapaziada ja √© mt foda tlgd kkkkkk.Enfim, darei 4 estrelas pq √© um filme bom sim, s√≥ n√£o foi 5 pq o enredo do vil√£o foi mt broxante, pois mostraram quem ele era desde o inicio e isso n√£o deu um plot twist foda, e pelo fato do final aberto. √© isso"
The Matrix,"absolutely adore the idea, hate the execution."
The Matrix,"Kinda just super weird, maybe I‚Äôm not the target demographic. Lots of iconic scenes"
The Matrix,"Como dijo buchita en su review es un must watch, amazing storylineAhora entiendo todas las referencias q hacen .Fr yo soy el chosen one ‚òùÔ∏è se ve cuero keanu"
The Matrix,penza sous snus est une meilleure actrice que keanu reeves
The Matrix,"God I hate this movie. It‚Äôs painfully bad in its effects (just go with practical effects. They‚Äôll always look better. Like seriously), and the message comes off as just a They Live ripoff. I watched The Matrix once a couple years ago, and never intend on seeing it again."
The Matrix,I think this must be my first time watching since knowing Lana & Lilly Wachowski are trans because the trans agenda‚Ñ¢ really hit me this time!! incredible

The Matrix,As a transwoman I am legally obliged to give this movie a 5 star rating
The Matrix,"Isaac Keanewton with all the gravity he invented, Keanu Erivo w/ the gravity he defied"
The Matrix,"I need to watch this again, got distracted and stopped understanding the plot. Can tell it‚Äôs a well thought out movie tho"
The Matrix,"um dos melhores filmes de fic√ß√£o (pelo menos at√© agora) cient√≠fica da hist√≥ria, cheio de cenas marcantes e conceitos interessantes.Tem algumas incongru√™ncias de l√≥gica e o casting n√£o √© t√£o bom, mas isso pouco afeta o resultado final"
The Matrix,I miss the ps2 game of this what a game

The Matrix,he really wanted to flex his moves first
The Matrix,Faut le temps de se mettre dedans dans la premi√®re partie du film
The Matrix,i fear that no matter how many times i watch this movie i will still be the same level of confused LOL but at least keanu reeves is in it.
The Matrix,I need 1999 matrix Keanu Reeves so bad it‚Äôs not even funny anymore
The Matrix,√â o √∫nico filme com o Keanu Reeves que gosto ü•≤
The Matrix,morpheus definitely gives off bisexual vibes
The Matrix,more iconic and culturally significant than good
11 Rebels,"Woo-hoo! A rebel will indeed!I originally planned to watch Japanese romance films this month, but I ended up diving into a movie I‚Äôve been eyeing for quite some time‚Äîand boy, wasn‚Äôt this a treat!11 Rebels explores the vastness of the Boshin War as it follows a group of prisoners who are tasked with holding a vital fortress against the Imperial Army until the Samurai Alliance left the domains of Shibata.As I researched more about the film, I‚Ä¶"
11 Rebels,"Me ha recordado un poco a 13 Asesinos de Miike, en cuanto a la forma de enfocar el chanbara y la acci√≥n‚Ä¶ pero, obviamente, se le queda muy, muy lejos en todos los sentidos. Pero no est√° mal."
11 Rebels,"Suicide Squad / Rogue One A Star Wars Story set in Bakumatsu-era Japan during the Boshin War.If that sounds awesome to you, you'll love this movie.However, it's a bit too long (around 2 hours 30+ minutes)."
11 Rebels,It‚Äôs like Suicide Squad but better
11 Rebels,"Buena historia y muy bien filmada ,pero a√∫n siendo muy entretenida peca de excesivo metraje ,dos horas y media se acaban haciendo largas ,pero cumple m√°s que bien"
11 Rebels,"Too balance tp ya gimana lagi, sesuai judule. Untuk penyuka gore gorean jepang cukup amaze dengan props seng menurutku iki sebuah peningkatan alias stonk cok temenan ra ngapusi akuSebuah jidaigeki yang menurutku beda dengan jidaigeki yang sudah tak liat"
11 Rebels,"I like this type of movie and once it gets going there are a number of fun plot turns to keep things interesting. Nice variety of action with a bunch of startling gory moments that look good on screen. I would say this is more referential than a classic of the genre, but if you like a shogunate samurai rebels ‚Äòn factions political strategy siege slicing off body parts time this is worth a watch."
11 Rebels,It is a little bit too long but it had some pretty good moments and it is representing a group of individuals that is more deserving of recognition. The writing is good and the ending is quite okay.
11 Rebels,"7 Samurai, 13 Assassins, 11 Rebels. What an awesome Trilogy."
11 Rebels,"""All these days my eyes are appetite for this.This is want exactly what I want in action genre.Feast for those who love old-samurai films.KAZUYA SHIRAISHI- Most important filmmaker in today film industry,Give him right recognition before too late.""BRUTAL, BARBARIC & BEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE IN CINEMA HISTORY"
11 Rebels,"I'm a rebel, the 11th one.11 Rebels is a fairly decent Historical Samurai Action film that has good action spread throughout the movie but it felt like there could've more done to it. With a running time of 2 hrs and 30 minutes, the story is simple and at times felt like a comedy but wished it delve deeper into history and had honestly those cheesy dramatic moments paired with equally dramatic music.The whole last remaining samurai or‚Ä¶"

11 Rebels,"It's like ""Dirty Dozen"", ""Suicide Squad"" or ""Rogue One"", but set in 1869 Japan.It's a bit too long but the ection sequences are good, the characters also and the story is interesting."
11 Rebels,Se me hizo bastante larga y con demasiados personajes
11 Rebels,bit overdramatic but ok for action freaks
11 Rebels,"Do yourself a favour if you haven't seen them already and go watch 13 Assassins, Harakiri, the original 47 Ronin or any Kurosawa samurai movie. If you've already seen them just watch them again and save yourself from this insufferable mess."
11 Rebels,"I've been tuned out on Shiraishi for a while, but I like how his grim sensibilities‚Äîwhich are usually plodding (and this does drag some)‚Äîcomplement this goofy 60s script. I particularly appreciated how much danger everyone seemed to be in..."

Einer unter den Rebellen f√ºhrt wiederum einen Verrat im Schilde etc.Visuell ist‚Ä¶"
11 Rebels,"Brabo, Toei fazendo Jidai Geki no mais ambicioso poss√≠vel."
11 Rebels,"You don't see many films set during the Boshin War, so was pretty excited to see this especially when it was advertised back in November 2024. The plot was the stock standard underdogs trying to defend against all odds, but the action was pretty solid. The campiness made the film fairly endearing, when you have a samurai ride up wearing a fedora and smoking a cigarette, you've got my attention. It's on Netflix at the moment, so solid action film for a quiet night but don't expect anything special."
11 Rebels,It's all over the place but the final arc is the best part.
11 Rebels,"The real suicide squad. In this film the choice on how and why you want to die is brought to the for front. For love, country, brotherhood, a promise, revenge. These are all brought up along with a lot of awesome sword fighting and a lot of blood. If you are a fan of films like 13 assassins you‚Äôll enjoy this."
11 Rebels,"If it keeps Kurosawa‚Äôs flame alive... I‚Äôm all in.The gruesome action is impressively executed, with solid performances across the board. The soundtrack is beautiful, enhancing the film's atmosphere. While the story can be a bit confusing at times and runs a little long, it still manages to keep me engaged.A very pleasant surprise!Note: If Daisuke Tsuji is not available, I'm ready forTaiga Nakanoto take the role ofJin Sakaiin a futureGhost of Tsushimamovie."
