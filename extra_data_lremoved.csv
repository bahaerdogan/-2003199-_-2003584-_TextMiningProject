Blue Ruin,lowest,"Another decently highly rated film on letterboxd that I just didn't enjoy. Maybe one star is a little harsh from me because the cinematography and acting were both really good but it was a poorly executed revenge story that I just couldn't give a shit about.This was the same director as Green Room which I enjoyed, so I was expecting this to be really good but it was the complete opposite. The pacing, writing, story and directing were very mediocre and I wouldn't recommend.26/100 📱"
Blue Ruin,lowest,"Um filme bem arrastado, uma história que poderia ser contada, muito melhor contada, em bem menos tempo. Protagonista sem graça e enredo mal explorado, muita coisa ruim neste filme. Uma história de vingança sem ritmo e ação, quase dormi."
Blue Ruin,lowest,boring and dumb with awhole lotta nothing
Blue Ruin,lowest,did not pay attention and did not understand the plot
Blue Ruin,lowest,"Absolutely terrible.The main character tries to teach humility to some peasantry, but they react without gratitude.So he has to keep teaching them.Eventually, instead of thanking him for educating them, they threaten to kill his sister, the spittle literally erupting from their mouths.So of course he needs to continue the lesson, until they internalise it.Then the director just decides to kill the main character after he's been taking out the trash. Why?Waste of time."
Blue Ruin,lowest,J'ai jamais vu un film aussi ennuyant et nul.
Blue Ruin,lowest,"I've never gotten the appeal of revenge movies. I mean, I get the idea of revenge seeming satisfying, but I never enjoy either part: the set-up (which is usually unpleasant because it's the bad guys doing something terrible to undeserving people), and the revenge (which is usually unpleasant because it's just delighting in the brutality which the set-up served to justify). Don't get me wrong: in probably every case, the bad guys deserve what they get; I just don't really…"
Blue Ruin,lowest,"It's amateur hour at Blue Ruin from 2013. You won't recognize any of the actors, apart from Buzz from Home Alone. The film is only 90 minutes, but so tedious and uneventful it feels like 190 minutes.I could not follow this movie. I did not understand what was happening. I didn't know who the characters were, what they were doing, what they wanted, or what the point of anything was. This film lacked basic audience awareness. It did not…"
Blue Ruin,lowest,تعرف يوم تقعد بالمجلس اخر الليل وجايب لك ليز ماكس وديو وفصفص وتشغل قناة امبيسي اكشن ايه نعم هذا الفلم من ضمن افلامهم
Blue Ruin,lowest,"Ga jelas , film bikin ngantuk, naskah ga ada seru serunya , sejam cuma fokus Ama satu orng yg ga jelas mau ngapain, masuk rumah orang bebas kali, kek masuk Indomaret, akting biasa aja flat ga ada bagus bagusnya , film satu setengah jam berasa kayak film 3 jam lama bangett, di ending nambah ga jelas , ini nembak siapa , eh dia nembak siapa , kocak kali, ada kesempatan buat bunuh , eh malah kabur ninggalin keluarganya , film ga jelas."
Blue Ruin,lowest,Only took one show to make me rate movies again. This was soooo boring. First it felt like watching home alone. My husband movie streak ended too soon
Blue Ruin,highest,held off on watching this for so long and this movie is heartbreaking but goddamn it's good
Blue Ruin,highest,Easily one of the best movies of the 2010s.
Blue Ruin,highest,"The keys are in the car the keys are in the carAlmost eleven years I’ve had this movie in my life and it has yet to lose an ounce of power. Macon Blair gives one of my all-time favorite performances as Dwight, a man whose life has been utterly destroyed by the loss of his parents. The path he takes in seeking his revenge is both sloppy-as-hell and distinctly human. He makes one (relatable) mistake after another because it…"
Blue Ruin,highest,"This aged like fine wine. Saulnier and Blair captured something special here. Such a lean film, absolutely no fat but a lot of guts. Absolutely love how Ratray comes out of nowhere to give the thesis of the film. A devastating but essential rewatch."
Blue Ruin,highest,You killed my father now prepare to die!
Blue Ruin,highest,Just finished writing an analysis of the revenge scene in this film for my college course (still one of the best and most underrated films I've ever seen).
Blue Ruin,highest,gotta be my favourite director fr
Blue Ruin,highest,"This is a perfect, awkward thriller."
Blue Ruin,highest,Goddamn this movie is good. It’s tight and tense. Exactly what a revenge thriller should be.
Blue Ruin,highest,Slick. Director doesn't waste time.
Blue Ruin,highest,"A lot of movies move the plot along, or slow the plot down, by making characters do the dumbest or most irrelevant things possible so it just feels like random parts are moving around for no discernible reason. This guy's movies are so tight and gripping because there is none of that. No goofing around, no needless monologues or dialogue, no meandering just to drag viewers through something the director insists on including. All of the events in his movies are causal and fast, which can make for a very scary movie."
Blue Ruin,highest,"After Rebel Ridge, I just had to go back. Spend some time in the dark with Macon. He's so fuckin' good. Like a schlubby terminator. Moments of odd humor pepper what would otherwise me a mercilessly black pit of human suffering. Absolutely delicious. I love this movie."
Blue Ruin,highest,"Now "" this is real Revenge Story ""Most revenge films sell the illusion of control—violence as a means of power, of setting things right. It have no such catharsis , satisfactory monologue . Blue Ruin dismantles that illusion piece by piece, leaving only the hollow, self-destructive truth behind. There’s no satisfaction here, no justice, just a man walking into a storm he doesn’t understand and can’t survive.Dwight, played with quiet devastation by Macon Blair, is not a hero,…"
Cold in July,lowest,"Cold in July wants to be like 7 different movies at once, and as a result it fails at being even one. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie as completely and utterly confused as this one."
Cold in July,lowest,"Started out good, then twisted into something that made no sense and left me with that WTF feeling.Loved Don Johnson"
Cold in July,lowest,most random movie i've ever seen
Cold in July,lowest,I guess it’s a cishet guy thing.
Cold in July,lowest,im just really done with the exploitation of women's pain so that random dudes can kick ass and look good
Cold in July,lowest,"Purtroppo, io non c’ho capito un cazzo."
Cold in July,lowest,"On paper it contains all the twist and turns you might expect from a good thriller, but in reality it's lacking in terms of suspense or excitement. The movie also lacks a real clear theme making it feel quite hollow when all is said and done."
Cold in July,lowest,"Cold in July AKA How to destroy a great thriller by turning it into a stupid ass story! Seriously, a snuff movie ring?! This stupid urban legend again?!What of the whole first act and the intricate story about the unindentified body in the coffin, the Mafia and the crooked cops???!!! They magically disappear in the second act! Voilà!Then watchout for the rest of the show in which I'm going to pull a cheap Dollarstore plastic rabbit out of my paper hat! What? You've seen that before?! Well hold on because this is where we're going!This is so stupid. Fuck you!"
Cold in July,lowest,"This is truthfully one of the worst movies that I’ve ever seen. The cinematography, score, pacing, direction, script, and acting are all extremely poor. This film feels like it was shot in a week, with no opportunity for reshoots. Many loose ends, character motivations that are never explained, everything sucked.Imagine a feature length episode of season 7 Dexter. Only worse. I cannot believe something like this made it past the cutting floor."
Cold in July,lowest,"story had great potential, had its twists and turns. but could have used better direction and writing."
Cold in July,lowest,"Uma primeira meia-hora interessante, depois ladeira abaixo."
Cold in July,lowest,"COLD IN JULY (Jim Mickle, USA, 2014, 2)Cold in July, for this Texas-set film, would be more believable than anything that happens in it. Yes, plausibility isn’t everything, but when you start out with as much psychological acuity and apparent seriousness as Jim Mickle’s Cold in July, you can’t turn into Death Wish; I call this “Fatal Attraction Disorder”. In the opening scene, Texas family man Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall) shoots a burglar in his home. It turns…"
Cold in July,lowest,“I got cows in that pasture.” - Jim Bob.
Cold in July,lowest,Man shoots an intruder and joins a gay polycule. He and his partners then go on a trip to destroy sex predators.
Cold in July,highest,Underrated gem. One of my favorites.
Cold in July,highest,Went into this for Michael C. Hall and didn’t have much expectation but holy shit. Texas noir 80 coded thrillers >>>> There were so many unexpected turns. The whole cast was amazing. I loveeeddd this.
Cold in July,highest,"Don Johnson is incredible in this movie. Love to watch the man act. Sam Shepard is a convincing and likable everyman.Michael C. Hall delivers a performance that is chilling at times, and even heartbreaking.The movie has some twists and turns that will genuinely keep you interested. Let your guard down, heat up some popcorn, and relax."
Cold in July,highest,John Carptenter’s Blood 8mm Simple.
Cold in July,highest,"Just love Michael C. Hall so much, this is so amazing, everybody plays their role perfect. I absolutely loved the turn this movie took, it’s just executed so perfectly. Perfect reward you get in the end, yet still a little depressing."
Cold in July,highest,"You got the picture, framer!A deep-fried distillation of '80s genre fare - horror, buddy comedy, sleaze, action, neo-noir - that unspools freely as a tautly unpredictable, tone-shifting, shit-kicking facemelter.Cold in Julyis also a film that crucially sidesteps the hollow nostalgic fawning over the neon-synth scuzz of that particular decade (which I'm sure we can agree the 2010s were a little too obsessed with) with a poignant central trajectory concerning the coming-of-age-of-a-forty-year-old Texan who is at odds with…"
Cold in July,highest,"Outstanding on every level. Taught, brilliant script. No spare words. Outstanding performances. Watch this one right now. Best film I've seen in a long time."
Cold in July,highest,Can’t believe there was a time where I thought this was anything less than five stars. Dudes friggin’ rock.
Cold in July,highest,"What if A Walk Amongst Tombstones and Dragged Against Concrete had a baby? It’d be Cold In July.Having the brains and blood splatter the painting during the opening scene was such a cool idea. Dane, Ben, and Jim Bob are some of the best written characters I’ve ever seen on screen. There was so much packed into their characters as soon as they’re on screen for a few minutes it feels like you know everything about them. Jim Bob being the best example (was very bummed I didn’t think he make it). This was a certified banger I look forward to watching again soon."
Cold in July,highest,"Third time watch and it’s masterpiece. Please watch it, you won’t regret it"
Cold in July,highest,"i think the problem with people who want border security is that they focus too much on fearmongering illegal immigrants’ personalities. there’s multiple sides to that argument like wanting to have less demand for products or jobs therefore having more supply, but the side i want to focus on is that not only are people not accounted for, allowing them to be exploited by businesses, but children are also not accounted for, allowing them to be exploited by something maybe more…"
Cold in July,highest,"I love it when a “you messed with the wrong guy” type narrative isn’t “turns out this guy was special forces, he killed Satan in desert storm,” and instead is more just “a hapless Joe Schmoe who finds in himself the principle to not let an evil act go unanswered.”"
Cold in July,highest,"best hotline miami esque film ive watched thus far, synth score don johnson and a neo-noir genre blend that's all you need to know."
Cold in July,highest,Cold in July is proof that great ideas can outshine a small budget.
A Hijacking,lowest,"Avec Hijacking, Tobias Lindholm nous plonge dans un presque huis clos, dans un bateau danois attaqué par des pirates. La tension monte rapidement et on se prend dans l'histoire. Mais le gros point noir du film est son traitement. Lindholm a décidé de ne parler que de rançon, d'argent et de négociation. Bien que ce ne soit pas inintéressant, ce n'est clairement pas le sujet le plus imposant dans un tel cadre. Ainsi, la psychologie des personnages, leur santé, leur…"
A Hijacking,lowest,Tam Nijerya seferi esnasında izlenecek film😇
A Hijacking,lowest,Remember when Tarantino kinda skipped jewelry heist in Reservoir Dogs? And like how cool that was for indie filmmaking? Like We dont need to show the most expensive scene!Yeah... dont do that unless youre Taratino.
A Hijacking,lowest,Beth Greenerealness sa isang scene 😂
A Hijacking,lowest,The beginning act was very sluggish and a chore to get through but the rest of the movie was fine afterwards. My biggest strife with the movie was that it was intended to be very character driven but there’s barely any room for empathy and the characters were very 2 dimensional and didn’t really have much personality
A Hijacking,lowest,"Really disappointing hijack drama about a group of Danish oil tanker workers taken prisoner by Somali pirates. The film is subtle and deserves credit for focusing on the realistic negotiating complexity of a hijacking situation... But ultimately, nothing really happens. It doesn't have very much depth, it's just a series of scenes between the Somali captors and the hijacked crew intercut with dour conference room scenes where tension is delivered by waiting for faxes to arrive (the oil tanker company…"
A Hijacking,lowest,I think paint takes longer to dry than running time of this movie. I think I would still rather watch the latter.
A Hijacking,lowest,"Tracking a fictional hijacking situation at sea, Tobias Lindholm's film values process over progress, where the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" play a politicking game of chess in which each seemingly trivial move is an irretractable act of positioning. If you're fascinated by a moody, slow-moving game of ""guess the number"" then A Hijacking will have you hooked but if you're looking for a bit of excitement and flourish in your thriller, you may quickly find your senses dulled by the vacillating…"
A Hijacking,lowest,"This was the movie equivalent of reading a newspaper article. It had all the facts and told you the story, but didn't flesh anything out or paint much of a visual."
A Hijacking,lowest,"Not as compelling as Captain Phillips, but I think more true to the story."
A Hijacking,lowest,not necessarily a bad movie but a movie that i absolutely did not enjoy.well made and interesting plot and defo worth reading about the director and the making of the filmthis is the kind of movie i have to read the wiki plot for beforehand so i don’t give myself an anxiety attack
A Hijacking,lowest,"I'm not sure you could have done less, or made a less compelling film about a hijacking. It's not gripping, it's not compelling, it's just dull and often very frustrating. I wasn't shocked to find out that Tobias Lindholm wrote (and directed) this film, having pennedThe Huntas well.There is rarely any emotion, little acting required and with almost four months at sea and very little food, the crew never seemed to lose weight at all. There were too many little annoying things like that that made this film very forgettable for me. And what an anti-climactic ending."
A Hijacking,lowest,"Idk if it’s studio meddling or just incompetency, but the editing here is awful. It feels like there is soooo much material missing. And it’s truly sad because the scenes, in itself, are all solid.Pilou Asbæk and Søren Malling are doing very well in their scenes. The camerawork and directing is okay. Nothing that stands out as good but nothing that stands out as bad either. The phone call between the cook and his wife was my fav part…"
A Hijacking,lowest,"An interesting idea, I guess, and probably a somewhat accurate representation of what these situations are really like—but in practice, this felt unnecessarily punishing and repetitive. Not that it's meant to be a feel-good film, but its relentless dourness felt undeserved.The portion taking place at the company offices was the biggest offender, with the CEO's stubborn bargaining scenes repeating themselves over and over, but the events on the boat weren't particularly eventful either. Realistic maybe, but for a fiction…"
A Hijacking,highest,Gonna do a bit more revision for my maritime security exam now methinks
A Hijacking,highest,Hadde vært så grovt å kunne somalsk til denne filmen
A Hijacking,highest,"Great film, this movie really shows on what the seamans cdo whenever they find themselves in a incident such as a hijacking by pirates. These film reminds me of the Captain Philips film."
A Hijacking,highest,Anything less than 5 stars feels unjustified.Extremely well done. I've watched some amazing Scandinavian films of late.Wouldn't want to be Mikkel at the end! Hope that wasn't a true anecdote from a real hijacking.
A Hijacking,highest,"A Danish ship is hijacked by Somalian pirates. A harrowing thriller shot with the intimacy of a documentary. The movie allows you to come up for air every now and again, but it’s a ruse. It doesn’t let up until its last dying frame. And the performances of all, are of the type that succeed in letting you forget they’re acting. This was exhausting."
A Hijacking,highest,"People from Scandinavian countries make cool movies. ie: Sweden's Let The Right One In. This atypical sea-bound hostage thriller is from Denmark. It's Captain Phillips but with more boardrooms and less Tom Hanks. The film cuts back and forth between the events on a hijacked ship and the hostage negotiation process back on land. The two main guys, the ship's cook and the head corporate dude, are great. Sounds mad boring, but is instead scary and tense."
A Hijacking,highest,A great representation on what and how the seamans will do and react whenever unexpected events such as a hijacking occurs. This film definitely reminds me of Captain Philips. Im glad that the ending was a good one
A Hijacking,highest,A stunning tense piece of cinema.
A Hijacking,highest,"This is a film about a cargo ship that is attacked by Somali pirates and the negotiations with the ship's company in Copenhagen. This film is heart wrenching and very suspenseful but what I think blew me away the most was how there is really no true antagonist. The filmmaker does such a great job at distributing empathy throughout the characters... As Renoir says in the French masterpiece, Rules of the Game (1939): ""The awful thing about life is this: Everybody has their reasons...."""
A Hijacking,highest,"Move over Captain Phillips, this is the pirate movie to watch"
A Hijacking,highest,"Harrowing but gripping tale focusing on the negotiations for the release of a hijacked container ship. The tension just ratchets up, you feel like you are in the room scared of how the hijackers will react. You can also feel the desparation of the hostages and the isolation they feel when they hear that their bosses won't just pay the money. You can see them slowly degrade and dehumanise as time goes on. An excellent film, all the better for ignoring the action of the hijacking itself and delving into the psychological torture of those on the ship and those back home."
A Hijacking,highest,"A suspenseful film about the hijacking of a cargo ship by Somali pirates. Unlike captain Phillips, this film focusses on the negotiation with the Danish CEO. Flipping between the boat and the office room where the negotiations are taking place, the film manages to be suspenseful in both locations with masterful acting. The drama which plays out feels very real, very bleak and very claustrophobic. Great cinema."
A Hijacking,highest,"The road to Denmark - the hidden gems⬅️I was completely on board from the beginning. A tragic and stressful race against time, with beautiful landscapes"
A Hijacking,highest,Wow. This is the pirate movie to watch
Loveless,lowest,I can’t believe that I wasted 2 hours of my life on this trash
Loveless,lowest,"It was beautifully shot and the acting was excellent, but the story and pacing were just dreadful. The second half during the searching felt like it went on forever."
Loveless,lowest,"смотрела его несколько лет назад. помню, физически подташнивало. жизнь в целом достаточно плоха бывает, необязательно об этом ТАК кричать."
Loveless,lowest,Hated every second of this tiring and pretentious film
Loveless,lowest,"Porra, muito lixo, vai se fuderPersonagens bosta, enredo bosta, enrolação fudida, não explica nada"
Loveless,lowest,"неее, это явно не моё - глубокомысленно созерцать два часа все ужасы человеческого бытия вшивого интеллигента-изобличителя. связующее звено ленты - пропавший паренёк - отвратительно плохо раскрыт, что заставляет усмехнуться мысли о том, что на него насрать не только родителям, но и Звягинцеву."
Loveless,lowest,"A fairly long while ago I read a brief collection of short stories by Shirley Jackson. I've been haunted by a couple of the stories it contained ever since, but the first one left a particularly indelible impression. It was The Missing Girl, wherein over just a handful of pages, Jackson describes the circumstances unfolding upon the discovery that a young teenage girl has disappeared from a campground, seemingly without trace. The succinct portrait Jackson paints of the mechanical way…"
Loveless,lowest,"Ai bicho, eu gostei de nada desse filme, personagens chatos, apáticos, não liguei pra trama em si, achei várias cenas desnecessárias e poderiam ser cortadas/diminuídas, com certeza, e toda essa tentativa de tornar as cenas mais naturais tornam elas entediantes. Oh Charlie onde fui nos meter.Alphabetical Challenge 12/26"
Loveless,lowest,"J’en suis au 2/3 du film c’est si peu intéressant, trop physiologique pour moi où tous ce que tu veux, même pas je termine.Des gens se sont donc tapéTheSquareetLovelessla même année à Cannes !"

Loveless,lowest,Shoutout Jack Caccavari because we both had to watch this piece of trash for class
Loveless,lowest,Didn't watch this but my bloody valentine SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loveless,highest,This is not a story about good and evil It is about parents who have never received love And therefore cannot give it to their child They repeat their mistakes over and over And do not learn from the tragedy The film does not provide a solution or comfort It deals with a harsh reality where love is absent
Loveless,highest,"This is a third time I've watched it and every time I am reassured that Zvyagintsev is total genious. Amazing movie, it drags you in from the very beginning with perfect acting and cinematography."
Loveless,highest,A suprise to no one. Russians make about as good parents as they do a functional Democracy
Loveless,highest,zivaginstevcigim benim psikolojimi bozdun bu filmle yeni film de yapmiyosun saka misin yaaaagg :(((((
Loveless,highest,"I am officially putting this as my second favorite film of all time. My rewatch hit, it hit hard. I’ve thought about this film ever since I watched it for the first time (years ago)."
Loveless,highest,Damn. Your kid running away must be a real bummer...
Loveless,highest,"I believe I was shown part of this in a seminar in 3rd year or something. Anyway, I should have trusted my gut; this is the most depressing film of all time and I hate it!"
Loveless,highest,"10 years after The banishment, this one cuts even deeper. It goes right under your skin.Another cinematic tour-de-force by Zvyagintsev. A dark jewel. Better than The banishment, in my opinion (and others).'Loveless' revolves around a young couple who lose not only each other but also their son in their marital struggle. When their 12-year-old son disappears, the couple is confronted with their own shortcomings.""Up until now, Russian filmmaker Andrej Zvyagintsev has only made good to excellent films,…"
Loveless,highest,"The story of Loveless is very captivating even though it's a patient slow-burn with a lot of long-takes, dialogue and a big emphasis on atmosphere. From the opening shot to the final shot it's a depressing experience with lots of unexpected turns, and it's a film that keeps you guessing and wondering even after the credits roll. It's one that sits with you and is on your mind for a long time after watching it.Our two lead actors, Maryana…"
Loveless,highest,"Кажется пересматривать ""Нелюбовь"" сразу после ""Похороните меня за плинтусом"" было плохой идеей, но я всё так же люблю этот фильм целиком и полностью."

Victoria,lowest,"Apostaron todo a ser un solo shot y se enfocaron en eso nama, ni se interesaron en hacer algo lógico.A verrrrr se entiende que quiera causar muchas emociones al mismo tiempo sin dejar al espectador pensar lo que acaba de ver perooooo el inicio pudo ser otro, mezclado obv con el inicio que esta ahora asi un pequeño background de ella quizás, no sé horas antes de ir al club. Tiraron todo muy impulsivamente 🫠 like y eso diq llevarse un tipa a lo loco a ser tu complice jjjjjLo único que me gustó fue el final y fue porque se acabó"
Victoria,lowest,"i stayed until an hour and 19 mins. i can't finish it. not with the messy camera work (altho i get it, it kinda like a vlog), but i still can't. not with vic's attitude. vic was bored so she joined a group of men on a night. nah. i just couldn't get into the storyline. i forced myself to finish it, but at least i passed the first hour. just not for me."
Victoria,lowest,"mirando las reviews de la gente y yo estoy pensando si me he perdido algo? No me ha gustado nada no sé esque no le veo el sentido a la trama, ninguna mujer se iria con 3 tíos random por la noche esque en la vida macho jajajajaj wtff he ido dandole 5sec a cada rato porque vaya truño"
Victoria,lowest,"No importa que sea un plano secuencia, nada justifica la seguidilla de malas desiciones, como que le dieron 12 páginas de guión a los actores y hicieron que improvisen, ni que algunas transiciones entre tomas no están logradas, y por dios el conflicto aparece a la HORA DE PELICULA, y no te puedo creer que (según wikipedia) ganó un premio en Sitges, no te la puedo creer."
Victoria,lowest,Me lembrou uns rolês de final de semana
Victoria,lowest,"Uma ladainha interminável que não conseguiu me provocar nenhum sentimento além de tédio. Os personagens são 100% desinteressantes, nem uma hora inteira de ""desenvolvimento"" antes da apresentação do ""plot"" foi capaz de dar alguma profundidade a eles. A trilha sonora é horrível (raro exemplo de uma que realmente me incomodou), a fotografia parece feita pra gente não enxergar nada. É tudo muito, MUITO ruim. Queria fazer uma petição pro Letterboxed aceitar 0 estrela como avaliação."

Victoria,lowest,"i hated this movie. idk if i can get into dramas if they are all going to be so long. additionally, it did not make me thrilled to fly to berlin today."
Victoria,lowest,Worse than hitting your own mother…As if any sane person would be so naive to follow such pieces of shit that are drunken germans…The worst movie I’ve watched in this year so far
Victoria,highest,Undeniably thrilling. Germany never feels like a normal place. Bad boys are too fun to ignore so I get it.
Victoria,highest,Probably some of the best acting I’ve ever seen. All in one take too which is insane. Meandering a bit towards the end but I don’t freaking care this shit was incredible
Victoria,highest,"This was one of the first movies I watched when I decided to try this hobby to find out what was out there. I was absolutely mind blown that I didn’t even gave a review. This is the one movie, that hooked me in this world and turned me into a cinephile. Probably the only one review that I didn’t do since I started this activity continuously, for almost a year now, and one of the most meaningful movies for me, that deeply touched me and made me fall in love with cinema. Thanks Victoria"

Victoria,highest,Ella solo quería tener una noche loca y ya😞
Victoria,highest,"The best german movie, it is not an understatemant. Because of this movie I had the dream of renaming myself Victoria. I saw it 2015 and can still not fathom how well it held up, how it depicts Berlin as this pseudo depressing realtiy, we all live through. How there is not one cut, sort of like Hideo Kojima was pocessing the director Schipper. Fantastic, chefs kiss! It is not talked about much in this cultural climate but we should all see Victoria."
Victoria,highest,"Every time I watch it I’m more blown away. This film has no contemporaries. Other one-takes either feel forced or have a scope too narrow to make the feat meaningful. Victoria, however, has an enormous scope that meets the moment at every turn.There’s no settling for mediocrity to achieve the goal. These actors give their all for the lengthy runtime and it ends up a true masterpiece that would be thoroughly enjoyable even if filmed traditionally.As we pass this films 10th birthday, I continue to hope it will finally get the mainstream recognition it deserves."
Victoria,highest,"Fuldstændig skørt god, har aldrig følt mig så meget en del af en film. Så sejt med one take, impro håndholdt kamera og fantastisk skuespil. Jeg følte at kameraet var mine øjne og mærkede alle deres følelser 👀🔥💫 måtte gemme mig under min dyne et par gange!! Fuck hvor var den god"
Victoria,highest,"Incroyable, je conseille fortement !!"

Victoria,highest,The power of friendship did not prevail
Victoria,highest,"değerli bi öneriyle izlediğim bu film; birçok açıdan şaşırttı.Kamera açıları olsun, oyunculuklar olsun, hikaye akıp gidiyor. anksiyetesi çok yüksek bir insan olarak bazı sahnelerde kalbim patlayacak gibi hissettim-bu bana ekstra bir zevk verdi- hikaye,dostluk ve dramı da çok iyi işlerken içine gerilim de katıvermiş. Nadir beğenirim böyle filmleri.   film önerisi Soranlara söyleyeceğim ilk 5 filme girmiş bulunmaktadır.thx mukilove ya"
Victoria,highest,"Wow, that totally came out of left field. A really tense movie that just snowballs, the thing is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent, but the acting is overwhelming. While the story is fiction, the people are as real as it gets."
Timecrimes,lowest,"Umgesetzt wie ein Hochschulprojekt. Das wäre ja ok wenn die Handlung originell wäre, aber wie so oft bei  Zeitreiseplots, wird hier einfach nur altes aufgewärmt.

Timecrimes,lowest,Nah don’t fuck with this it all took me like allDamn day to watch this could not get on board w this plot 👎
Timecrimes,lowest,"Didn't like how the movie treated the unnamed female character. Weirdly sexist.Plot wise this is nothing unique, I've seen this kind of movie enough times to think I myself might be in a time loop. Didn't really offer anything new except for the, well, cum pool I guess."
Timecrimes,lowest,"the protagonist is a fat, slow, stupid creep."
Timecrimes,lowest,This is one of my least favorite portrayals of time travel - causal loops can be fun (where you only do something because you did it before) but the origin of that action should have some meaning to it or some relation to the character’s will - making the woman take off her clothes in the forest for no reason just because he’d seen it before felt like a poorly chosen and unnecessarily explicit way to demonstrate this. Also was…
Timecrimes,lowest,Stupidest male protagonist ever.
Timecrimes,lowest,"If one have watched a handful of time travel movies, they alomst would have known what is happening and what is about to. With it being made one and a hald decade before, it might have been riveting then but I feel that it didn't stand the test of the time."
Timecrimes,lowest,"This felt very male gaze-y and the storyline was very basic. I was not entertained at all, so there’s 1 star for you."
Timecrimes,lowest,"O suposto melhor trabalho do Nacho Vigalondo apenas confirma minhas impressões sobre ele como diretor com as obras posteriores com as quais tive contato durante os anos: seus filmes não existem para além da primeira imagem, nem possuem qualquer imaginação para partir para o entorno de suas ficcionalizações que tanto querem firmar um lugar pelo gênero fantástico. Ele teve um vislumbre de como seu personagem poderia se parecer, o que poderia enfrentar seguindo essa cartilha temática de ficção científica, como poderia erotizar o olhar do público com as atrizes, e esqueceu de como sustentar todo o resto depois dos primeiros trinta minutos."
Timecrimes,lowest,"I’ll be quick: this movie is dreadful. It tries to be smart, to be dark, to be somehow good, and it catastrophically fails at everything it does. It’s not surprising, it’s not intense, it’s not enjoyable at all. And worst of all: despite being 80 minutes long, it makes you sit through it as if it were a 4 hour long feature — behaving as if it were profound, moving awfully slow… and, let’s be honest, making you feel as if you wasted 240 minutes of your life when you haven’t even wasted 90.I still can’t believe how awful this movie was, really… *sigh*"
Timecrimes,lowest,"Idiot man defies darwinism, unfortunately."
Timecrimes,highest,"Aqui ele foi gigante, simplesmente uma aula! 😍"
Timecrimes,highest,Hector is the unemployed friend on a random Tuesday
Timecrimes,highest,Brilliant. Very good concept and very well done.
Timecrimes,highest,This is one of the most excellent and well-developed time travel stories ever to be put on screen. Shame the bike girl went through all that.
Timecrimes,highest,"Proof that you don't need a big budget or special effects to make compelling sci-fi. Simplicity in the setting works as the script, mood and performances are so tight and wonderfully engrossing. It's stressful, which is layered through the increasingly disastrous effects of how the film portrays it's time travel concepts. It's small in scope and it benefits massively from that restrained. The film aesthetic could of been very dark and hard to distinguish, but you can see everying from…"
Timecrimes,highest,... y entonces vi los cuásares fuaaah y los púlsares fuaaaaah...~ En casa con Isaak ~
Timecrimes,highest,"talked about forEpisode 001 of my podcast alongside The Time Machine (1960) with guest Taylor Wilson, also available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and wherever else :).was thinking 4.5 or 5, but this has stuck with me a bit since watching it. Part of the reason is that I really like The Swimmer, and this gave me major The Swimmer vibes. And I love little 90 minute movies. And I love the way it was shot. And I loved how lurid it went. Yeah, 5 stars, I think perfect. Excited to see other of Vigalondo's work!"
Timecrimes,highest,"How the fuck can't Hollywood compete with a movie with a budget of two millions, names you never heard of and music which sounds so old it could be royality free again?The execution, the concept, the characters, the actors, just everything clicks very satisfyingly together. Yeah, even the music. I can't fathom how Nacho Vigalondo wasn't overly night a second Christopher Nolan. I mean, okay, he did work one time with Elijah Wood, but that seemed to be the death of his carrer, sadly. Speaking of, Open Windows just jumped massively on my watchlist!"
Timecrimes,highest,"HOLY HELLThe less you know about this movie going in, the better"
Timecrimes,highest,"fui me engalfinhando cada vez mais nessa teia de aranha que quando vi, tava todo embolado. filmaço que te prende do início ao fim"
Timecrimes,highest,"Wow. Fantastically plotted, paced, directed and acted! Amazing film that answers most of it's own questions which is rare in time travel movies. Most of the time there are massive plot holes, but here it is more of mildly odd decisions by the main character at most. But at the same time, Hector seems to be sort of a mild mannered every day sort of dude, not really have been prepared for being thrust into a time travel situation.The…"
Timecrimes,highest,Trama bastante simple pero la forma en la que te la cuenta es muy buena
Timecrimes,highest,اكتشفت مؤخرًا إستعمال آخر لchatgpt قمت بإدخال التصنيف الذي أريده وقام بأقتراح لي هذا الفيلم وهو فعلا هذا ما أردته غريب يشد انتباهك ووقته قصير .حسنًا إذا لم تشاهد triangle فغالباً لم تتعرف على الفكرة إطلاقاً ولكن أن شاهدته ستعرف ما سيجري نهاية الفيلم التشابه بالاحداث وليس القصة بحد ذاتها هو يتناول معنى الندم معنى الأقدام على شيء سيئ والمحاولة لإعادة الزمن لاصلاحه لكن هل يقف الزمن لأجل واحد من مليارات البشر
Timecrimes,highest,Lo que veo cuando Vigalondo no está en casa.
The Guilty,lowest,"Not sure why this is getting such rapturous praise (currently sitting at 99% on RT). I thought this was incredibly boring. Words like “nail-biting”, “tons of twists-&-turns”, “gripping” & “clever” were used but I never experienced any of that during the film.The plot concerns an emergency dispatch officer who receives a troubling phone call. This is a single-location movie similar to such films like Phone Booth, Buried & Locke; the latter being used as the most obvious comparison as the film…"
The Guilty,lowest,Thrillers work mostly due to a threat to their featured protagonist. Cortes' Buried is tense because Reynolds is buried alive and tries not to die. It's not just about resisting death. But... WE CARE! The threats here are happening not to the character seen on screen. And we don't connect to them dramatically because of the mystery. They are even a total stranger! An idea destined to flounder. And it does!
The Guilty,lowest,i was hoping i’d like the original better but i think the execution was still poor and i hate the sub plots
The Guilty,lowest,"Dette er en ekkel film. Dårlig er den og. Fysjom.En av trailerne til filmen var the equalizer 2, og her er noe, det er ekkelt at det her tema med mislykkede-enistøing-menn-tar-loven-i-egne- hender-og-hevner-krenkede-kvinner er sånn en greie. Tvisten hjelper ikke. Og hvorfor er ikke dette et hørespill? Jaja."
The Guilty,lowest,"The more I think about this film, the angrier it makes meI can't fault the acting or pacing, and the premise is brilliant,However, what begins as a gripping and timely thriller, in which a domestic violence situation becomes a terrifying ticking clock, is ultimately a story of villifying mental illness while absolving or glossing over the violence and abuse of power of men"
The Guilty,lowest,El prota se sacó el título de detective en la tómbola de su pueblo. Requete ACAB.
The Guilty,lowest,never knew a movie can make me regret this much I saw it. der film war SO was von without sens. ✨wasted 90 mins of my life✨
The Guilty,lowest,فیلم بود یا نمایشنامه رادیویی؟؟دو سه بار فیلم استپ کردم تا یک کم قابل تحمل بشه برام. همش موس رو تکون میدادم تا ببینم چند دقیقه ازش مونده. اصلا قالبش سینما نبود.
The Guilty,lowest,Was so hard not to fall asleep.~Half a star.
The Guilty,lowest,"I didn't care for this movie. Watching one guy for 90 minutes isn't that exciting even if the story was pretty good. This, much like Locke, fails."
The Guilty,lowest,من ازبل الافلام الي شفنها برود مو طبيعي اقسم بالله فلم بس يبي يرفع ضغطك مو يشدكالعن افلام بالدنيا الدنماركيه اقص ايدي اذا شفت فلم من هالديره الخرا
The Guilty,lowest,"I never got around to logging this because fffffffffuck this film but news is there’s an American remake on its way?KEEP IT.Make better choices, Jakey G."
The Guilty,lowest,"This is vile trash. Obvious as hell and doesn’t have nearly enough material for its slim runtime, and initially it seems like it’s going to run the protagonist’s redemption arc through a domestic violence narrative. That’s gross enough, but then there’s a completely reprehensible “twist” that basically turns the film into wank fodder for Men’s Rights Activists.Fuck everyone involved with the making of this movie.Edited to add: I'm baffled by everyone praising the sound design because I found…"
The Guilty,lowest,"It feels like a first year film student's project, painfully predictable. I kept watching in hopes of it giving me more than a weak twist but I wasn't left with much."
The Guilty,highest,"Very high on my list of awesome experiences inside the Kimball Tower. I was kinda worried that staying inside the office the whole time would feel gimmicky, but it was so far from that. I was also worried that it would be an oversimplified, over-glorified portrait of a cop, but it was again, very far from that.It was incredibly written, paced, acted, and shot. I think I was most impressed by the actors we didn’t get to see. Lots of emotion in just voices. Awesome!!!!!!"
The Guilty,highest,"Media película pasó en mí cabeza?Esta película es un viaje de ida y vuelta a la psiquis del personaje principal, que nos va demostrando aspectos cada vez más oscuros de su personalidad, y cómo está dispuesto a llegar hasta las últimas consecuencias en un intento de ayudar.El director cuestiona la noción del deber y de hasta qué punto uno realmente está haciendo el bien, dejando importantes incógnitas morales.Tiene un guion excelente, pues con tan solo un personaje…"
The Guilty,highest,"ha sido la hora y media más tensa y con más golpes, que ya me veía venir, PERO ES QUE ME HA DEJADO A TEMPERATURAS MÍNIMAS IIGUALMENTE."
The Guilty,highest,definitivamente melhor que o americano
The Guilty,highest,"The best film I’ve seen with a one location premise, also completely in real time so the suspense is crazy.In between the dramatic moments of tension and action you just watch the protagonist wrack his brain trying to figure out what to do next - that is cinema"
The Guilty,highest,The writing and acting it takes to make a movie this good while all events take place through a phone call is incredible. This is a first watch masterpiece.I haven’t watched the Jake whateverhall version but I think it’s safe to say that you’d be doing yourself a favor to just read subtitles.
The Guilty,highest,Ubeskriveligt pres jeg var under kan jeg godt lig love for hold da helt kæft en film. Godnat🫡
The Guilty,highest,this is way better than the jake gyllenhal versioni love how great denmark is at making moviesdannebrog🤘🇩🇰
The Guilty,highest,This is perhaps the most intense and claustrophobic experience I've ever had. The film grabs you and does not let go for a single second as you watch a dubious dispatcher stumble his way through a nightmare scenario. What earns me the five stars is that it did not let up even at the very end. It continues to get deeper and more complex while utilizing only one backdrop. The dialogue although translated from a language I do not speak…
The Guilty,highest,"So much better than the remake, Americans, stop doing stuff"
The Guilty,highest,Çok iyi dünyanın en msrafsız filmi ama fena geriyo ve adam çok üzüldüm fen oyunculuk sıkılabilirsiniz ama geriliyorsunuz yanında biriyle izleyin sıkılmazsınız çok güzel izleyin
The Guilty,highest,Alarm center police guy. Who is the actual guilty person. Thrilling. Holywood made a remake.
The Guilty,highest,voy a recomendarle esta película a todos los que conozco
The Guilty,highest,Had to watch this in preparation for acting class. Masterful suspense thriller. Doesn’t leave a moment to waste and you are on edge the whole time especially with the twists and turns that ensue throughout the duration of the picture.
The Guilty,highest,"Så denne som overraskelsesfilm der Sivert bestemte og satt på film uten at jeg visste hvilken det var og fy søren den var knall!!Selv om jeg hadde fått noen skikkelig triste nyheter rett før var det veldig lett å leve seg inn i og bli engasjert i!!Likte også veldig godt at han var en skikkelig drittsekk som ble alt for personlig investert i jobben sin, og alle rundt ham sa han burde dra hjem, og så gjorde det…"
Calibre,lowest,"If I could give it negative stars I would, legit a waste of time"
Calibre,lowest,"I watched, like, 10% of this movie, & then I fell asleep."
Calibre,lowest,Why does this movie have 100% on rotten tomatoes.
Calibre,lowest,"Honestly one of the worst films I’ve ever watched. Predictable and boring,"
Calibre,lowest,"parabéns pra o cachorro farejador, que encerrou esse filme de uma vez. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻também quero agradecer a netflix, por ter feito o primeiro filme que eu dei meia estrela. e ainda errar a classificação.odiei que ele encarou o fundo da minha alma, como se fosse eu que matei uma criança. xô, homem maluco. vai cuidar da tua criança vai"
Calibre,lowest,es tan mala que ni me acuerdo de qué se trataba y la vi hace no sé un mes
Calibre,lowest,Completely uninteresting and predictable movie with zero suspense. They tried too hard to make the film realistic to the point where it just wasn't interesting. At no point did I give even the slightest care about any character. Anyone saying this film was thrilling or anything short of completely fucking boring was paid off by netflix.
Calibre,lowest,Half star for the Scottish accent
Calibre,lowest,What a shite movie. Honestly don’t even waste your time.
Calibre,lowest,au moins les paysages sont beaux
Calibre,lowest,"Too slow and dragging for my taste. I usually enjoy these types of films. The ones where 'unsuspecting city folk go to pokey, rural villages in the backend of nowhere and encounter unfriendly locals'. The first 20 minutes where mildly interesting, due to my enjoyment of the lighting and dark/warm colour scheme, highlighting the two friends relationship to each other. I could believe they were long time school friends off for their boys' get together.We witness two morally ambiguous…"
Calibre,lowest,"Bourré de meurtre, d’hommes blancs et de fusils. Merci papa d’avoir choisi ça au lieu de Marriage Story!! 🤘🏼"
Calibre,highest,"so tense, so well paced, things being revealed in the perfect order, totally harrowing and horrible. beautifully shot and scored. a gem"
Calibre,highest,"Fantastic movie, never knew what was going to happen next! 10/10 recommend!!"
Calibre,highest,Intense! It’s your cup of tea if you like being disturbed. It is a smooth thriller and you are likely to end up depressed for the rest of the day.
Calibre,highest,"A rare gem on netflix!The relentless momentum kept me constantly on the edge of my seat that I had to press pause a couple times midway. The suspense is real!What was supposed to be a fun last trip of freedom turned into a bleak never-ending nightmare. It's a movie about choices and their consequences.Audiences were forced to be engaged in every turn, and yes, it's harrowing. It puts us in the heart and mind of the main…"
Calibre,highest,This film is so good #noscotlandnoparty
Calibre,highest,"If you want a really tense, 90ish minute movie and a lot of depth this is and ez recommend"
Calibre,highest,Brits know how to make Indie thrillers. A must watch for no thrills thrillers.
Calibre,highest,Pure anxiety all the way through AH
Calibre,highest,The way this film was not at all what I expected. Just kept me on edge throughout. Jack Lowden is the 🐐
Calibre,highest,"Amazing film omg just great all around. Great acting, great ending, great story just throughly entertaining. Makes you think what would u do in this situation"
Calibre,highest,Sat on the edge of my seat start to finish
Calibre,highest,"So simple but deeply complex. What would you do? What should they have done? When did things go wrong? So many incredible ethical dilemmas to analyze.Plus we talk about what dinner scenes mean and symbolize.Also, I thought of a take so good, it might be one of my all time best.Desert of the Reel Podcast"
Calibre,highest,Amazing one!! That confession scene and the climax was so good. Loved it.
Calibre,highest,An immensely gripping film that transports you to the Scottish Highlands and the drama that unfolds throughout the film. Gets better with every watch and is the perfect film to watch before a hike.
Calibre,highest,What a series of bad decisions made by two intelligent men. Hard to watch.  But I did and couldn’t turn away!
Coherence,lowest,like watch it if you want but….wow that shit is bogus
Coherence,lowest,fui assistir esperando um suspense assassinatos serial killer etc recebi filme sobre falha no espaço tempo 😭😭😭😭
Coherence,lowest,"Muito ruim, não aguentei nem ver ele todo. Péssimo"
Coherence,lowest,the night housebut make it for $1 with the worst actors you have ever seen in your lifethis was genuinely so awful i had to check the release date mid-watch because i becameconvincedthe only way you could put out something this cheap-looking and poorly crafted was because you were stuck in quarantine with a bunch of your actor friends and trying to pass the time. nope! made in 2013.
Coherence,lowest,if i could rate this a zero i would. i hated this movie to much it was so confusing i hate improv
Coherence,lowest,White peoples version ofUSbut lower budget.
Coherence,lowest,didnt finish. i did not care for the characters
Coherence,lowest,pior filme que eu assisti no ano de 2025 pqp
Coherence,lowest,"Eu achei até que estava sob efeito de algo assistindo esse filme, confuso, louco, e incompreensível, terminei sem entender nada."
Coherence,lowest,bobeirada meu deus me deu ate sonoo tema eh legal mas porcamente trabalhado e produzido
Coherence,lowest,"quien me devuelve la hora y media de mi vida que perdí viendo esto?. Me pareció horrible y ni siquiera merece una opinión, mis viejos me dejaron elegir pelicula, vi que la recomendaban y termine viendo una película espantosa"
Coherence,lowest,Written and directed by Viihtube
Coherence,lowest,i want to move to an alternate reality in which i didn’t waste time to watch this piece of shit
Coherence,lowest,"ASSISTIDO EM 22/03/2025.Título no Brasil: Coerência.Uma obra de produção dos Estados Unidos e Reino Unido, tem excelente crítica e foi considerado um dos melhores filmes de ficção da década, mas não para mim.Achei a história fraca, enrolada, pouco envolvente, confusa (não por ser complexa, mas por ser mal executada), incoerente e com personagens infantilizados.Perda de tempo em ter assistido e continuar comentando."
Coherence,highest,"Como eu amo filmes que apenas são. Não te explicam nada e nem fazem questão de você entender nada, são apenas histórias que acontecem. Não tem início meio ou fim (literalmente nesse caso), não existem devido ao spectador mas apesar dele."
Coherence,highest,Annoyed all of my loved ones with hypotheticals after this one
Coherence,highest,Easily the most underrated sci-fi film. This will leave you scratching your head.
Coherence,highest,coherence is the most creative horrifying mind bending sci-fi film I’ve ever seensomething about it gets under my skin and makes me feel so uncomfortablethis one’s perfect in my eyes
Coherence,highest,"Such a brilliant MINDFUCK of a movie, expertly executed despite a very low budget."
Coherence,highest,"Quando eu vi, obriguei meus amigos a verem também"
Coherence,highest,?CUAL DE TUS REALIDADES ESCOJERAS PARA SER FELIZ?
Coherence,highest,What?What?WHAT?!??I’m freaked out this is the movie that makes me can’t go pee alone.why
Coherence,highest,wait why do i want this to happen lowkey 🤓
Coherence,highest,letterlijk zoooo een goede film ik recommend deze echt hard moest je van beetje mind fuck houden
Coherence,highest,low budget mind bending underrated masterpiece!!!!! reminds me of the movie triangle(2009)
Coherence,highest,"Absolutely one of my favorite movies. Super well done and wildly suspenseful, holds up after multiple watches, in fact it’s best to at least watch it twice if more than once. So give it another go if you’ve seen it before, you’ll catch stuff you missed the first time, this is your sign to rewatch it, it’s less than 90 minutes long."
Coherence,highest,"o melhor jeito de assistir é sem saber nada do filmequando vc vai entendo oq está acontecendo é tipo muito loucogostei muito, fiquei pensante demais no final"
Good Time,lowest,"""You choose your own truth.""Cross the room if you are a homophobic, racist, narcissistic, misogynistic, and pedophilic person who sexually assaulted a minor, did blackface, stole a bank, and was romanticized in the movie (that is also racist and the directors/producers are involved in pedophile and sexual assault accusations) from start to finish.Connie Nikas crossed the room."
Good Time,lowest,"chato, previsível, repetitivo e problemático"
Good Time,lowest,"this movie was boring as hell & then when the main character (a grown ass man) started hooking up with a 16 yr old girl, i turned it off. hard pass."
Good Time,lowest,what’s wrong with the cameras? I’m dizzy
Good Time,lowest,Frustrating plot and unsatisfying ending
Good Time,lowest,shit from a butt. poop from an ass. doodoo from a colon. wonderful dream for white guys
Good Time,lowest,guys this was so bad what’s with the think pieces in the reviews
Good Time,lowest,"i’m chris hansen, and this is To Catch A Predator"
Good Time,lowest,Worst movie I’ve ever seen. Got convinced by my roommates because reviewpig said it was good. Worse than mad max and that’s saying something. Never listen to a reviewpig recommendation ever again.
Good Time,lowest,It makes perfect sense that this is one of Pete Davidson’s favorite movies (derogatory).
Good Time,lowest,"not because it’s bad, but because of my inability to finish this it gives me the worst panic attack ever whenever i do (great movie otherwise)"
Good Time,lowest,"If you are in a good mood but don't want to be, this the film for you.But not because the film actually tells a compelling but devastating story, rather the occurances and character dynamics in and of themselves are. If it were shot as a documentary, it would have been equally depressing, since the film does not really add anything to the absolute misery depicted here."
Good Time,lowest,I'm sorry I was yawning so bad.
Good Time,highest,"Crime/Thriller is such a hard genre to try and distinguish yourself in but Good Time does it amazingly. Despite being such a dark and serious story, the film is full of color and beautiful shots. Robert Pattinson portrays a man on the brink of losing his freedom so well and keeps you invested in a character that you know is in the wrong. The movie picks up so fast and never slows down. Every situation seems even more absurd than…"
Good Time,highest,still fresh and a thrilling watch
Good Time,highest,this random greatest movie of all time. the safdie brothers could write the godfather but francis ford coppola could not write connie nikas top 10 problematic moments.
Good Time,highest,I love this movie. Beginning to end had me on the edge of my seat. So suspenseful. Robert Pattinson Kills this movie. This movie made me realize I like him as an actor
Good Time,highest,That is how you tell a story. It doesn’t matter if this guy is completely irredeemable I still need to what is going to happen next. I’m going to be appalled by what happens next but I’m not going to take my eyes off the screen because it’s too good.
Good Time,highest,when he’s covered in pink dust… idk that dominos bathroom is my favorite scene.
Good Time,highest,fuck this was so fun and crazy and RAHHHH i loved it and everything abt it fuck i love r patz
Good Time,highest,Je l’ai regardé avant de dormir ça m’a trop stressé ouf
Good Time,highest,always love a movie that can keep me clenched and also robert pattinson
Good Time,highest,Don’t be confused; it’s just gonna make it worse for me.Pretty sure I knew these guys in high school.Pattinson crushes in this. Extremely stressful experience all around. Five stars.
Good Time,highest,"stunning, gorgeous, incredible, perfect"
Good Time,highest,This is the definition when u friend calls u to hang out at 3am 10/10
Good Time,highest,I genuinelly believe that this is the greatest movie ever made. Robert Pattinson's performance was amazing. The cinematography is perfect. The writing is geniously written. Just everything about the movie is great. Seriously reccomend this one. Please don't make it a filmbro movie
Good Time,highest,Very successful at making me uncomfortable. Excellent to watch
The Invitation,lowest,they need to give us negative ratings.HORRENDOUS
The Invitation,lowest,"Se tivesse uma orgia no final desse filme, pelo menos eu sairia com a sensação de ter visto algo inesperado.Parece ter sido feito para quem acha que gosta de thrillers, mas na verdade só quer algo confortável e sem riscos. Não tem suspense, não tem reviravolta – só uma jornada linear rumo ao óbvio, com um terceiro ato que entrega exatamente o que você imaginou antes mesmo dos créditos iniciais terminarem."
The Invitation,lowest,The most BORING film I’ve ever seen
The Invitation,lowest,"This movie was very predictable. To me, it bad and stupid."
The Invitation,lowest,"Horror? Thriller? mystery?The plot is quite predictable, 5 mins in you know somethings wrong, 8mins in you know already whats going to happen …Absolutely no surprise no real plot no horror. Sure you feel uncomfortable but is mostly cause you are just waiting for “what you know its going to happen” to happen"
The Invitation,lowest,The lead Actress was fantastic. That was all that I found was  worthwhile of myself finishing this dull and pulseless ( No Pun Intended) scare free; fumble of a film.
The Invitation,lowest,What the fuck this movie was dumb as hell i am so done. Waste of my time I cannot believe this has a 90% rotten tomato rating. The “big plot twist” wasn’t even that crazy like i am not happy
The Invitation,lowest,"Terrible acting, predictable as shit and shallow to the point you can’t connect with any character whatsoever.It tries to make you think by keeping some elements of the story/past hidden but all it does is cheaply try to entice the viewer.The premise is so cool and the whole thing is just a mess"
The Invitation,lowest,"I ate some lettuce spinach mix that seemed to be going through some sort of fermentation process while watching this, so I guess this one is on me"
The Invitation,lowest,"Awful script, more than halfway through the movie and still just really weird. Waste of time. So terrible fr. What even. Dumpster dire truck of a movie."
The Invitation,lowest,"Couldn’t even get past 30 minutes of this one. Every one’s acting except the main guy was horrendous. Super slow, not even a little enticing. Maybe one day I’ll try again. Doubt it though."
The Invitation,lowest,I can’t think of anything to say right now but there is a haunting flashback scene where main man is in the bathtub with his spooky wife and then the son comes in and the dad is like “uhhh son go away nothing to see here” and the son just creepily smiles. And it’s kinda portrayed as supposed to be endearing
The Invitation,lowest,literally how does anyone like this movie.. from the first 15min u know how it’s going to end and then you just have to sit and listen to the most unbearable dialogue for the next hour thirty minutes. nothing happens until the last 10min and even then it’s BORING!!! this movie is BORING!! literally not tense at all just watching the main guy be like omg guys something is wrong!!! for the whole movie and then. woah. he’s right!!
The Invitation,lowest,"Incroyablement chiant ptn, j'ai même pas la force de décrire ce que je viens de voir tant le film m'a lessivé. Même le twist était fatigué de lui-même"
The Invitation,highest,Pruitt and Claire prolly had a lovely chat and exchanged numbers…
The Invitation,highest,"“The Invitation” begins as a seemingly innocuous dinner party but quickly transforms into a slow-burn thriller that probes deeply into grief, trauma, and the dangers of conformity. The film’s brilliance lies in its ability to evoke unease through quiet moments and subtle tension. Kusama’s direction is meticulous, using the claustrophobic setting to amplify the paranoia. The slow revelation of the guests' motives and the tension-filled atmosphere lead to an utterly chilling climax. ""The Invitation"" is a masterclass in psychological horror, leaving you questioning your own perceptions and choices. An unsettling exploration of human nature at its darkest."
The Invitation,highest,Watched again still so so so good
The Invitation,highest,"beautifully crafted, explores unsettling themes of community"
The Invitation,highest,"You must go in blind.Tense, chilling & unsettling.With only a 1 million dollar budget, it shows that idea and execution is everything. Lesson learned, always trust your gut."
The Invitation,highest,This is what happens when white rich people get too bored
The Invitation,highest,This movie really makes you think “what if I were in that situation?”
The Invitation,highest,I’ll never forget cutting out of work early to watch The Invitation at IFC Center. A thoroughly gripping thriller that doesn’t waste a minute of its runtime. Unshakeable tension leading to one ofthemostmemorable and unsettling final acts. Cannot recommend this film enough. In Karyn Kusama I trust.
The Invitation,highest,really good watch slow start but crazy ending fun from a psychological thriller and a slasher perspective some continuity errors but i’m cool w it :3
The Invitation,highest,"A movie about a cult and a slow burn, some of my favorite things."
The Invitation,highest,where do i find more movies like this
The Invitation,highest,"Everything about this movie works. There’s so much tension building, it keeps you locked in the entire time, and actually convinces you the characters are worth caring about. Incredible sound design and soundtrack, incredible cast."
The Invitation,highest,This was a really good movie. I enjoy films that take place in one setting. I like how you knew something was wrong the entire movie but you can’t really put your finger on it til the end. The ending definitely pays off. There could have even been a sequel in my opinion.I like how it tied in to the death of his child. This movie was working through a few layers
Ida,lowest,if there like a law in poland where all their movies have to be about ww2
Ida,lowest,"Pawlikowski acts like an excited child who obsessively plays with one toy. His academic ratio compositions that wowed the audiences are so dull, decorative and meaningless that after 10-20 minutes into the film, I was beating myself out of boredom, hoping to witness something real and worth watching among these ""magnificent"" pictures. Alas, it failed me through and through."
Ida,lowest,"Its relentlessly grim and never really comes to grips with what makes Ida tick, so we feel very little for her, or anyone, which is a problem. If you have a knowledge of the politics of this era after the war no doubt you will understand the dynamic more fully, but an average movie goer wanting to be entertained will find nothing here. It's lovely to look at and shot in the old fashioned 4-3 format in beautiful black and white, and the characters move in and out of the frame - which is interesting, but not the first time this has been done. Extremely depressing."

Ida,lowest,"Score: 4/10Replay Value: NoneWorth Buying: NoIt's not because it's in Black & White or it's 1:33 aspect ratio reminding me of the film Mommy (2014). It was soooo boring. I love Foreign Films and I guess my expectation for this was just too high. There wasn't enough happening enough for me to even pay attention 100% of the time.

Ida,lowest,The story had so much potential if they would’ve actually focused on the script instead of aesthetic shots and her beautiful face for every 2 seconds. I hate when they do that
Ida,lowest,Yawn. Only thing great about this film is the cinematography.

Ida,highest,"emocje są tam gdzie nikt ich nie wypowiedział, a intymność tam gdzie nie ma nagości. film nie krzyczy i pozwala poczuc, dawno nie mialam takich odczuc po filmie"
Ida,highest,"Really beautifully made movie. A lot is conveyed with minimal dialogue or connective tissue. Difficult to know what to say about the movie, but to hit upon the main points, Ida is about her exposure to the world before taking a nun’s vows, a glance at what her life could be outside of the devout path, and learning about her family that is alien to her. What her life is not/ what her life would have been without the holocaust…"
Ida,highest,"Ida feels like holding your breath for 80 minutes..and realizing you never exhaled.Shot in stark black and white, with frames that leave characters dwarfed by silence and space, this film doesn’t scream. It stares. It asks you to sit still, to feel the weight of identity, grief, and history with no filter, no excess..just quiet devastation.Ida, a young nun about to take her vows, learns a truth that shakes everything she thought she knew. Her journey with her…"

Ida,highest,I will never get over how beautiful this film is
Ida,highest,"A quiet and somber exploration of womanhood, search for identity, multigenerational trauma, and past affecting future, set in 1960s communist Poland."
Ida,highest,"¡Es una road movie con dos personajes tan dispares como el agua y el aceite! Y luego se convierte en un manifiesto sobre la insatisfacción, la crisis y el sentido de la vida. Me impresionó cuando la vi y me sigue impresionando cómo cabe algo tan perfecto en tan solo 80 minutos.Mucha gente considera que ‘Cold War’ es la obra maestra de Pawlikowski y no lo cuestionaría, pero ‘Ida’ me parece un poquitito mejor simplemente porque ‘Ida’ hace más preguntas incómodas y tiene planos que te expulsan ese tipo de suspiros largos que te hacen recordar lo que ya no fue."

The Painted Bird,lowest,I just remembered this movie sucks literally one scene in particular just came back to me like damn ptsd. This movie is horrible and pointless and literally should die and be vilified idgaf.

The Painted Bird,lowest,Can i give a film 0 stars?How people can call this entertainment and a must watch if you are a cinephile i have no idea. Its a snuff film.
The Painted Bird,lowest,"Two hours into the most terrible, horrible, no good, very bad series of events I’ve ever willingly been made witness to, there’s a Wilhelm scream. Jerzy Kosiński and Václav Marhoul are both hockers of undeserved misery porn. Kosiński stole and stitched together the work of a ton of other people and lied about it being autobiographical. Marhoul is smarmily going whole hog to make a pretentious art film. I don’t use the word “pretentious” lightly. This is its definition."
The Painted Bird,highest,La pelicula mas dura que he visto en mi vida
The Painted Bird,highest,"Um filme horrível, mas incrivelmente belo visualmente.O final me deixou triste, mas com esperanças de que ele consiga reconstruir uma vida, que mesmo tão curta, já está tão marcada pelas atrocidades.Todos os gatilhos podem ser disparados, não aconselhável para quem não assiste filmes sobre os horrores da guerra."
The Painted Bird,highest,"Increíble esta película sobre la maldad y el alma pútrida del ser humano. Hace honor del cine que resalta con suma belleza el horror. Lo hace al mejor estilo de los maestros soviéticos. Te rompe en pedazos, se va a convertir en tu pesadilla durante días. La intención es que cada imagen te persiga y te preguntes por qué me odio tanto para consumir esto. Pero a su vez es una pieza que debe estar, debe existir, digna de ser admirada."
The Painted Bird,highest,"Rapaz, nunca vi alguém passar por tantas diversidades quanto esse garoto.

Tô ansiosa pra ler o livro.Pax ✌🏾"
The Painted Bird,highest,"Hace tiempo quede fascinado con toda la estética de 'Come and See' (1985) de Elem Klímov y creí no encontrar algo similar hasta que me tope con este título. Si bien hay años de diferencia, The Painted Bird no tiene absolutamente nada que decepcionar en comparación con la ya antes mencionada obra de Klimov.Brutal y cruda en todo su máximo esplendor, pero eso sí, maravillosa en sus recursos técnicos como por ejemplo su fotografía, sus planos, encuadres y por…"
The Painted Bird,highest,"Não sei se a história original desse filme (do livro) pode ser considerado como uma história antipolonesa, mas o tanto de coisas que o ser humano fez de cruel durante a história, as coisas mostradas nisso aqui não deveria ser uma surpresa.O Holocausto e a segunda guerra em si é uma prova do que somos capazes de fazer uns com os outros, e isso aqui ressalta essa análise, só que de um jeito digno de um conto violento do…"
The Painted Bird,highest,Just FASCINATING!One of the most incredibly in-depth show case of war through the eyes of a kid.It shows how cruel can humanity be.And the cinematography just blew my mind.It's sheer perfection.

The Painted Bird,highest,"""The Painted Bird"" é um filme que retrata a jornada brutal de um menino sem nome vagando pela Europa Oriental no final da Segunda Guerra Mundial. O filme é uma adaptação do romance de Jerzy Kosinski e é dirigido por Václav Marhoul.

Leave No Trace,lowest,bro what was this movie deadass
Leave No Trace,lowest,watch any other movie ever created and it would be better than this
Leave No Trace,lowest,Una película que cree que te transmite y te deja algo pero no pasa nada de lo anteriormente mencionado
Leave No Trace,lowest,"Half star is far too generous. If you think a guy with untreated PTSD stubbornly dragging his kid into his problems is something to be glorified, this movie is for you. If you are into watching the grass grow, this movie is for you (however, be advised that when you watch the grass you can catch something remotely interesting happening, contrary to this movie). Easily makes my top 5 worst movies of all time."
Leave No Trace,lowest,Me and my family found it really boring
Leave No Trace,lowest,"The most boring, slowest, most depressing movies ever. The only movie worse than this was Marley & Me. If this movie was based on a true story, then ok. But this was just a made up sad story? Like why? It does not deserve a 100% score AT ALL! That's just absurd and outrageous. And it now calls every score into question. Simply insane."
Leave No Trace,lowest,Worst movie of all time. Dad gave up two free houses so his daughter could freeze in woods because he has ptsd? Seriously. Grow up.
Leave No Trace,lowest,"I wanted to like this movie so bad. There I was, watching the trailer, reading some reviews, and getting really excited about this movie. So, I rented it and pressed play.Not long into the movie I lost all interest. The emotions weren't there despite the good acting and the pretty decent script. I liked the locations, the father and daughter relationship, but the movie just didn't sell me. It felt surface level on basically everything they wanted to talk…"
Leave No Trace,lowest,TERRIBLE MOVIE. Can’t believe this got 100% on rotten tomatoes. You wait the whole movie for a pay off or something to happen and nothing does. That’s all that needs to be said or I’ll get more mad about it.
Leave No Trace,lowest,I watched this a couple years ago with a friend who used to watch and discuss movies with me every weekend. We walked out of this movie and agreed to never speak of it again.I don’t know who decided this was a good story but it was the most painful display of parenting on screen I think I’ve ever watched. By god please see a therapist.
Leave No Trace,lowest,"esse é um dos filmes mais chatos da história, não tem início nem fim É SÓ MEIO QUE INFERNO"
Leave No Trace,highest,I think this film captures the feeling of alot of people in this country who after being or feeling rejected by society no longer choose to accept help from it. America is going through a massive shift right now and I think alot of people just don't understand some people don't WANT help. They don't WANT modern society. Maybe their lives would improve maybe not but you can't force people to accept it. Every society has its outskirts and people…
Leave No Trace,highest,Almost as good as Winter's Bone but much less painful to watch.
Leave No Trace,highest,idk in what combination or direction but somebody failed somebody here
Leave No Trace,highest,"Filmde gereksiz tek bir diyalog ve tek bir detay yok. Oyunculuklar, müzikler, doğal ortamlar… hepsi birbirinden mükemmeldi. Daha önce izlediğim Into the Wild ve Captain Fantastic karışımı bir filmdi. Olağanüstü kusursuz bir film 🍿 🎬"
Leave No Trace,highest,“Where’s your home?”“With my dad.”Everything about this movie is so beautiful and heartbreaking. I’ll never forget watching this with my dad and both of us just being stunned at the ending. Such a good movie.
Leave No Trace,highest,"Leave No Trace is one of those films that says a lot through seemingly simple means.While contemplating on it, I asked myself: is it a simple film, or a pure one?It is, in fact, a pure film — a beautiful demonstration of restraint and authenticity.When you consider its emotional arcs, its portrayal of nature, and its exploration of the human soul, Leave No Trace delivers a quietly powerful and complete journey."
Leave No Trace,highest,"The quietness is blissful.Gentle people with gentle souls, trying to live a gentle life.An ex military father suffering with PTSD chooses to remove himself and his daughter from society, but society keeps dragging them back.Both Ben Foster and Tomasin Mckenzie, who plays his daughter, portray their characters with a stillness that could easily be boring, but instead is utterly compelling.A beautiful film."
Leave No Trace,highest,somehow cried even more the second time around
Leave No Trace,highest,"Debra Granik is the greatest American director to emerge this century. There may be better directors from America, but none of them understand both film and the United States as well as she does. What a brilliant film."
Leave No Trace,highest,Just wonderfully acted. Brilliant. Thomasin McKenzie was superb
Leave No Trace,highest,DEBRA!!!! drop another narrative feature and my life is yours!!
Leave No Trace,highest,I could write a book on how good this is but honestly no one wants to read it. This is seriously one of the best fucking movies I’ve ever seen and I’m so bummed it took the death of one of my favorite singer songwriters to learn about. Absolutely incredible on every front.
Leave No Trace,highest,"Debo empezar diciendo que si bien el ritmo es más que adecuado para la historia que se cuenta, se puede sentir un poco lento, en especial si estás acostumbrado a películas de acción.Dicho esto, amo me gustó mucho. La película trata varios temas importantes pero de una manera inteligente. No está llena de sobre exposición con diálogos cargados. Al contrario, hay muchas cosas que no se dicen y uno debe ir deduciendo.La historia trata de un papá y…"
Leave No Trace,highest,"So simple and genuine, lack of dialogue actually makes a really good script in this example and leaves more room for emotion and the things not said between them. I absolutely adore the acting in this film throughout. The green tinted colour grading as well makes the film so luscious and bright showcasing the world and wildlife they live in compared to the modern world.Side note: bloody hell this film was nearly made entirely by women I had no idea and this is like my third watch."

Children of Men,highest,One of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. The way the world is built for us in those lingering background shots is incredible. So many good long shots and maybe one of the best long shots ever in the final scene.One of the few movies that did it better than the book. I will watch anything Alfonso Cuaron does after seeing this.
Children of Men,highest,locked in from minute 1. What a film
Children of Men,highest,Some of the greatest anguish ever portrayed.

Children of Men,highest,We need Cuaron back making movies.
Children of Men,highest,"I heard this was great, but I'm still blown back. This movie is phenomenal. Its rare that a movie just fires on every single possible cylinder. Its deeply thematic. You can just draw so many lines between what happens in this dystopic future and what is happening right now (and what was also happening back in 2006, but still people will be like ""Children of Men predicted wisely"" when things have never really changed). It is deeply affecting, getting you…"
Children of Men,highest,"Masterful from start to finish. I’ve been meaning to watch this for years and it did not disappoint.Immediately I felt immersed in this movies world. Everything feels so authentic and lived in. The movie does such a wonderful job of giving you just enough information so you understand the current state of the world. All without obvious and forced exposition.The filming style has a personal feel to it, focusing on the characters as the action happens around them.…"

Sooooooo dramatic, boring, stupid plot, and disgustingly vulgar for no reason. I hated this so much I simply couldnt finish it, and I really tried to force myself to.

The Handmaiden,lowest,Tbh i don’t understand the high ratings it was garbage
The Handmaiden,lowest,"I am immediately skeptical of people who think this is as good as—or better than—OldboyorSympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Like the Coen brothers doingNo Country for Old Men, I really don't see the point of faithfully adapting literature that is already innovative within its own medium.Oldboyworks so much better because Park Chan-wook elevated the lackluster source material by reimagining it into something completely different. The story in this film is good, I guess, but the credit goes to the author, not the director, since he didn’t adapt it in any meaningful way. An artistically stagnant, pointless film."
The Handmaiden,lowest,🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 le réalisateur le plus surcote de l’histoireLe mec peut pas raconter une histoire sans que le sujet principal soit le sexe il est écœurant déjà queOld boyc’était dégoûtant mais encore l’histoire en elle même est correcte mais la c’est vrm à vomirJuste les décors et les tenues qui sont bien dans ce film mais sinon y’a rien à gratter
The Handmaiden,lowest,only thing I liked about this movie is girls running through a pretty scenery laughing together and hurting men’s egoPs: don’t watch it tho it was ewwww
The Handmaiden,lowest,"Pathetic, Park Chan-wook put such genius audio-visual language, used in speculation, in the South Korean feminist most rampant time, he shot this to kneels to lick women's rights. He's a good director, but he's also a shrewd opportunist. The film did not win awards at Cannes and the Blue Dragon Awards, and Park Chan-wook deserved less status than Bong Joon-ho. This film, as a contrast, Bong Joon-ho's true artist persistence and dignity are more displayed, which is why Bong Joon-ho is the director who won the Palme d 'Or and the Oscar"

The Master,lowest,"This picture uses PTSD as an excuse for the lead to be an asshole. Reductive and harmful representation. I've got PTSD and you don't see me walking around like a violent little shit. Also, considering women are TWICE as likely to have PTSD it's actually egregious that PTAnderson decided to make the movie (that has nothing to do with women) insist on objectifing women.Make a movie about specifically male-experienced, war-related PTSD--great idea!-- YOU DONT HAVE TO SACRIFICE YOUR FEMALE AUDIENCE TO MAKE A MOVIE IMPACTFUL🖕"
The Master,lowest,I hated this movie with every fiber of my being. Not quite as much as I hate Beau Is Afraid or broccoli or Tom Brady or Bon Iver or Market Basket or UVA or the state of Connecticut. But I hated it a lot. Fuck this movie.
The Master,lowest,I'm not coming with this movie. It's hogwash in my opinion.
The Master,lowest,Horrible movie. I finished(no pun intended) and literally said out loud wtf did I just watch.
The Master,lowest,"Juste jag försökte kolla på den två ggr för jag litade verkligen inte på dig tyra när du sa att den var dålig….Men du hade rätt å jag kom inte ens igenom hela, mitt hat för joaquin phoenixs karaktär var för stark och hela vajben som filmen utstrålade var äcklig 🤢"
The Master,lowest,"its very confusing, very random, very idk man what got in me that decided to watch this?"
The Master,lowest,Esse eGravidadea80km/hpra ver qual é o pior.🤮
The Master,lowest,Saw this forever ago and nothing happened. Literally the movie has no events occur. Everyone else who says it has any meaning is a liar and dumber than they think they are.This movie is doo doo fart for normal people.
The Master,lowest,NO i prefer watching two black men kissing

The Master,highest,Ok now stick it back in it fell out
The Master,highest,I feel sick and dazed after watching this. I’m not fully sure I understood everything but I felt every scene. I can’t even think of anything to write about this.
The Master,highest,"A drunk meets a man named Lancasterwho fancies himself a proud pastor.They each have their ends,but they quick become friends,both looking for his own Master."
The Master,highest,"Throughout much of my lifetime, as such with anyone else, I have gone through a number of different friendships that have fizzled out for one reason or another. There have been multiple different occasions where I would consider someone my “best friend”. There are two that stand out in particular, and for the purpose of this story, I will refer to them as A and B respectively. While both obviously had their own distinct characteristics, I think they both fulfilled…"
The Master,highest,"This film feels like one of those AI-generated images where you think you see many objects, but the closer you look, the more it dissolves into an unrecognizable mass. Paul Thomas Anderson doesn’t offer us a story, instead he offers a feverish dream of wounded souls, stumbling blindly through the fog.Freddie didn’t truly need the Master, even though he had always been loyal to someone. It was Dodd who needed Freddie more. Together, they orbit each other like twin…"
The Master,highest,every single actor gave a 10/10 lifetime performance in this
The Master,highest,not to brag but i think i understood this
The Master,highest,If if if you if you already know the answers to your questions then why ask Pig FUCK
The Master,highest,"If you need someone to play a middle-aged sexual deviant, call Joaquin Phoenix. Please Lancaster you gotta stop inviting your drunk sexual deviant over. I don’t even think he wants to get brainwashed."
The Master,highest,For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?Matthew 16:26
The Master,highest,"Watched this a couple years ago and admittedly was confused.Watched again last night and then woke up this morning and watched it again. I can firmly slot this as my favorite PTA movie now. I know everybody was dying to know. These are facts that I’m giving you, they are not opinions. They are FUCKING FACTSI just wanna see more Hoffman :("
The Master,highest,I loved every minute of this movie and the unreal hallucinatory nature of certain scenes.
The Master,highest,impressive how a single human wrote this moviejust proves why he's one of the best to ever do it.
The Master,highest,"Its that kind of a movie that reminds why you fell in love with cinema in the first place.It is a screenplay that is beyond my comprehension and exceeds limitlessly. There are some elements that we rarely find elsewhere. It is the connection between the two main characters. I may not be old enough to fully understand the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour, that instant liking for a person to come at such old age would surely…"
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,"The magical, mystical elements are absolutely incredible. Whats even more incredible is that 90% of the runtime gets taken up by vapid characters in an uninteresting storyline."
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,je remercierai jamais ma prof d’espagnol de m’avoir montré ce film
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,Honestly one of the worst movie I’ve ever seen
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,i hate fauns i despise them stupid ugly creatures just thinking about them fills me with rage. stupid movie hate is not a strong enough word fck fauns AND this movie
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,O filho da puta que fez esta merda deveria ser açoitado.
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,Quiero probar lo mismo que el que escribió esto
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,Such a huge disappointment…. I really thought I would love it and at the end I was just super bored for the whole movie 😩
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,"La peor película que vi en mi vida. Lentísima, la protagonista es un personaje secundario y se debería llamar ""el laberinto de los militares de franco"". Muy aburrida y mal escrita. Le daría 0 pero no se puede"
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,I HATE this movie with a burning passion. I watched it in Spanish class and was traumatized. El fauno is a DISGUSTING pedophile. Just writing this review and thinking about this movie HURT ME.
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,Love fantasy but really hated this
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,"I'm not sure why so many people give great reviews. I watched it last with my bf, who wanted to watch it again as it was one of his favourite films when he was younger. we lost interest after 30 min or so.the plot is hella dry and predictable, the characters are shallow like puppets and the dialogues are so bad.it's like watching a bad disney film with your little cousin – but i think if i had…"
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,"El trauma de mi vida, dios mío las pesadillas que yo he tenido. 💀"
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,"Isso daqui vai fazer sempre parte dos meus pesadelos... Não planejo ver isso tão breve, quer dizer, acho que nunca mais. Assistir uma vez já foi o suficiente.Além de eu achar chato, me assusta."
Pan’s Labyrinth,lowest,"from the overengineered sound to the overused mask wipe transitions and the cliche characters and tropes and the unnatural lighting and the shitty vfx and the shitty day for night and the shitty characters with no development, you know a movie sucks when the folino is fully laughing AT a horror movie. i’d give up anything to be schizo with this little girl bru give me whatever she’s on"
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"Favorite movie that I watched with my mom, she says I look like the child"
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"just the most amazing film i have ever experienced :,) yearly rewatch!!"
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,That THING traumatized little me
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"The folklore style and mild occult touches made this a good watch for Half-O-Ween/Walpurgisnacht. Very beautiful and melancholy, and still feels very European and very “Del Toro.”"
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"Guillermo Del Toro might have the most beautiful and creative mind on earth. He knows how to tell a story so damn well. Everything from the VFX to the acting, this is an easy 5 stars"
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,this movie is a childhood dream.
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"Amazing, every part of it. The end was actually sad and movies don’t normally make me sad man."
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,I would die for Mercedes. But it wouldn’t do much good. She’s too dumb to live.
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,ubbidire senza pensare; preferisco morire
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"Al que no le gusto esta pelicula no entiende de cine, es sumante cautivadora y con una direccion de actores envidiable."
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"oh this hurt so bad but mr del toro, im a masochist so do it again"
Pan’s Labyrinth,highest,"Man, I love this movie so much. I just had to watch it as part of my monster movie marathon tonight."
Heat,lowest,"For a guy that has a monetary goal he’s trying to reach, Burt Reynolds’ character sure likes to turn down money in whatever way he can. Dude knows how to shatter a kneecap in a single blow tho."
Heat,lowest,"Ich habe gerade Burt Reynolds Biografie gelesen, er ist eine absolute Ikone, die hier leider selbstverliebt durch einen Film wandert, der aus guten Gründen an den Kinokassen und Kritikern brachial scheiterte. »Charles Bronson für Arme« wäre noch geprahlt, so konfus und langsam zieht sichNICK, DER KILLERdahin. Natürlich sind ein paar Trashperlen enthalten, wie etwa die irre Scherenszene im Psychopathen-Apartment. Das Fazit muss aber leider lauten: Zäh wie ein Aldischnitzel – ich bin dreimal eingeschlafen und meine Frau hat mir das Ende erzählt."
Heat,lowest,"Classic ""a movie about the making of the movie would be better than the movie"" movie."
Heat,lowest,Burt Reynolds y Las Vegas… esta peli se hizo en 1986 para que yo viniese ahora y la gozase.
Heat,lowest,This looks and feels like a made for television movie. Burt looks bored and the action scenes are badly dated.I’m just confused how William Goldman could write this.
Heat,lowest,"Much slower than I was anticipating. It has some good moments spread throughout and the final 20 mins or so are a good time, as he takes down the Vegas goons but a long lead up until that point."
Heat,lowest,"The first ten minutes sets Burt Reynolds up as a completely unlikable and creepy sexist jerk. However, as it turns out, that was just a trick he's pulling on someone. So you finally breathe a sigh of relief thinking ""ok, Burt's not really a jerk."" But then the rest of the film starts... and he's still kind of an unlikable jerk. Why am I watching this?From here, the story is all over the place; and Burt's character is sometimes…"
Heat,lowest,Absolutely the worst Burt Reynolds movie and maybe in the running for one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen.It takes something to be as checked out as Burt in this film. Especially when you factor in him punching one of the 6(!) reported directors. The whole thing feels like early 90s TV movie shit that even as a 7 year old I knew sucked.
Heat,lowest,"So Burt, Peter MacNichol, and Howard Hesseman can act but every single other actor (and there’s quite a few of them) in this film CANNOT ACT AT ALL. Even the doctor in the last scene who has like one sentence to say is bad. It’s almost worth watching just to see how bad they all are."
Heat,lowest,there comes a point in every william goldman story where it’s like hey. what are we even doing here
Heat,lowest,Burt Reynolds is OK and Peter MacNicol is great but the story and direction are completely inert. The movie only picks up when Burt fights the E Street Band.Still haven't seen Michael Mann's Heat.
Heat,lowest,"Of all the movies ever made named Heat, this is one of them. Burt Reynolds does a great impression of Norm Macdonald doing a Burt Reynolds impression, and this would be a rare pitch meeting where Ryan George's conversation goes ""it must've been really hard for him to get out of that situation""""actually, it was super easy, barely an inconvenience!"" MULTIPLE times."
Heat,highest,"TUBI📱Started this on my breaks at work as I fancied a bit of Burt Reynolds coolness and after a few minutes I thought I have seen this before and yep it wasn't this film but the Jason Statham film 'Wild Card', I never knew that was a remake of this film, lots of it shot for shot but in a more modern Las Vegas, I did prefer this original version tho with my cool moustache and the more dirty…"
Heat,highest,I was expecting a shitty 80's beat m up movie with a lot of coke. Ended having a movie with an pretty good plot and better characters. Sirus is my hero!
Heat,highest,An expert in edged weapons....nick escalante
Heat,highest,What a joy to find neo noir + direct to video vibes + freeze frame high kicks + a high kick of a light fixture that sets a man on fire + a master / apprentice subplot + sleazy Vegas + an extra outlandish Reynolds outfit + a wood-paneled strip club / arcade + a lawyer named Pinchus Zion + a Venetian gondola ride + lines like “I’m going to rip your face off” and “I want his balls in my hands” ALL IN ONE FILM which Altman was perhaps wise not to direct but which you would be exceedingly unwise not to watch!
Heat,highest,"This is Burt Reynolds in a Charles Bronson movie. It's violent, sleazy, and tonally all over the place. I loved it."
Heat,highest,wanna be on Burt Reynolds like water is on wet if you know what I mean
Heat,highest,Hard-boiled dumb guy noir at its finest.
Heat,highest,Alternates between kitschy fun and being legit good. Wide ranging character study.
Heat,highest,no way I watched this whole movie thinking it was the 1995 one 💔
Heat,highest,A too old boozy and snoozy Burt smirks himself around Vegas not taking any guff. I love the lived in feeling this has by showing a wide variety of Vegas townies as they slap Burt on the back and ask how he is doing.Shout out to the editor that knew slow motion was necessary when Burt (stuntman) makes the five foot leap from a building into some loose sand.
Heat,highest,"A great time at the movies. Somehow still haven’t seen the more popular Heat, but this one’s a blast."
Heat,highest,"If you have a mid-'80s action picture with a troubled production it's almost always a banger.90 minutes of just hangin with Burt at his coolest, definitely the second best movie calledHeat."
Heat,highest,"This film came out of nowhere. Reminiscent of Saint Jack, The Nickel Ride and Lookin’ to Get Out. A languid tone and wholesome male friendship (just ignore the studio ending, and stay blissfully ignorant of the BTS.)"
Heat,highest,"Action FortnightBurt Reynolds is one of my all time faves. It takes a long time for the action to get going but when it does, daaaamn. Loved this.Blu ray"
Memories of Murder,lowest,Why people like this movie? IdkThis was one of those movies where I’m wide awake and I started to be jealous of those that are sleeping 😭 this movie was so boring I legit started to get drowsy!!! At 7pm!!!! 😂
Memories of Murder,lowest,"a todo el mundo le parece una obra maestra y a mi me parece una puta mierda, que coñazo y encima como es un coñazo e estado viendo el móvil y no me enterado de un pijo, igual la vuelvo a ver en otra ocasión pero vamos que una puta mierda que asco dios"
Memories of Murder,lowest,"Je suis fou, je crois que je vis une hallucination collective. Tout le monde a ADORÉ le film (un des mieux notés de tout letterbox) alors que j'ai DETESTÉ je comprend vraiment pas. Rien à retenir du film, aucune envie de savoir qui est le meurtrier, tout les personnages sont détestables et c'est loooooong"
Memories of Murder,lowest,"""ele tinha um rosto comum""Acho que essa frase foi só pra mostrar ao público que basta você ser um homem pra você cometer todas as atrocidades possíveis e sair impune de tudo. O filme é frustrante como eu pensei que seria, e é fiel em mostrar a frustração dos policiais e também o abuso de poder, mas confesso que, por toda migalha de expectativa que eles deram de que poderia revelar quem era o assassino, eu fiquei rezando para que no final fosse o policial que ficou com uma perna só."
Memories of Murder,lowest,Genuinely the worst movie I’ve ever watched. Like I just wasted so much time of my life for the worst movie I’ve ever watched.
Memories of Murder,lowest,"QUE FILME HORROROSO, SEM SENTIDO, CHATO, CANSATIVO. MAS O FINAL, A PORRA DO FINAL, ESTRAGOU O FILME INTEIRO.

Memories of Murder,lowest,"Stupid and boring. The cops are clearly supposed to be idiots, nothing wrong or unrealistic with that, but sadly the movie outdoes them. Clearly, they would've pounced on Baek's role as an eye-witness to avoid media humiliation, which they were concerned about, but no, they just forget it. So it's like a dull procedural but without even a meaningful plot.To make matters worse, the streaming service I watched this on had sourced the movie from the Criterion re-release, where…"
Memories of Murder,lowest,"I admit I only watched 20 minutes of this before I turned it off, but I honestly couldn’t imagine sitting through 2 hrs of it. The actors performances are so laughably bad, I don’t understand how this film has a 4.4 star average. Just look at the facial expressions on the poster here on Letterboxd — those raised eyebrows on the left are a joke. How am I supposed to believe that clown-ish expression belongs to a serious investigator of…"

Memories of Murder,highest,"Meu Deus, isso é incrível.Eu amo o jeito que esse filme nos faz desconfiar de tudo e todos, e ele faz isso de um jeito perfeito. Ele cria uma atmosfera sombria em cima dos personagens que nos fazem até mesmo desconfiar dos próprios policiais, pelo menos eu desconfiei, e foi daquele parceiro do Park, que é meio agressivo e tal.Eu adoro o jeito que esse filme aborda as interrogações policiais nada humanitárias, vendo as cenas é até difícil…"
Memories of Murder,highest,"There’s a silence in Memories of Murder that lingers long after the credits roll - not just the silence of unresolved crimes, but the kind that sinks into your bones. Bong Joon-ho doesn’t just craft a murder mystery; he builds a portrait of a country in turmoil, an atmosphere thick with frustration, incompetence, and quiet desperation.The film moves like a slow, tightening noose - absurdly funny in moments, then suddenly brutal. Each scene is soaked in paranoia, heavy rain,…"

Memories of Murder,highest,So it can be anyone then. I'm having a stroke right now.
Memories of Murder,highest,Murder mystery marinated in rain and pure hopelessness.
Memories of Murder,highest,"The most anti cop serial killer movie I think I’ve seen. I’m used to later era Bong Joon Ho, which breaks up the bleakness with moments of levity. I think Bong growing up in the most repressive era of his country’s government had an impact on him."
Memories of Murder,highest,"It is safe to say thatMemories of Murderis one of Bong Joon Ho’s best work yet.An incredibly gripping storyline and serve an haunting reminder that, no matter what, women are never truly safe. Even when the evidence feels obvious, the truth at the end remains a mystery."
Memories of Murder,highest,"You must have known that this movie is directed by the famous Korean director Bong Joon Ho who directed the Academy Award winner Parasite (2020). You must also know that this is based on the true story of a serial rape and murder that took place in a small province in South Korea in 1986.The story is dark, twisted, violent but funny in the right proportions. The ambiguous ending of the movie is unpleasant and haunting because the mystery…"

The Raid,lowest,"A night at the ballet. Minimal exposition. Nonstop action. It’s not a great movie per se but it doesn’t haven’t to be, it’s essentially a dance movie. It’s amazing to me that this movie cost barely $1 million and was choreographed by its two leads and looks literally 100x better than the $100+ million Mortal Kombat with all the infinite Warner Bros resources at their disposal (the fighting is also significantly better-shot & -edited than most big-budget Hollywood action period). Why doesn’t Hollywood just hire guys like this to make their cheesy video game adaptations and superhero schlock?"
The Raid,lowest,"Another interesting look at gaming culture in the early 2010s, but there are better films out there."

A atuação de Daniel Day-Lewis, que foi aplaudida como obra-prima, é uma caricatura insuportável de si mesma, um espetáculo de exagero que em nada contribui para a construção do personagem ou da história.

There is a typical anti-American focus on the corrupt aspects of American history. The…"

There Will Be Blood,lowest,"All of this gorgeous photography put towards possibly one of the dullest scripts ever written. Daniel Day Lewis is not good, and anyone who thinks he is must love those “Best Acting Compilations” on YouTube. PTA is best when he is cynical and witty, not dull and facile."

There Will Be Blood,lowest,"Was really looking forward to this movie. Shame it was gray, boring, and humorless. Could have used someone like Whedon."
There Will Be Blood,highest,"“There Will Be Blood” is less a film and more a biblical epic soaked in oil and ambition — a portrait of capitalism’s corrosive hunger, delivered with volcanic precision. PTA conducts the chaos with Kubrickian control, while Day-Lewis gives a performance so seismic it might’ve fracked the Earth beneath him. It’s a symphony of greed and solitude, scored by the howls of a man who dug too deep. Also, I drank a milkshake right after and haven’t emotionally recovered since."

There Will Be Blood,highest,"This is top 10 for me without a doubt, best film to come out of 2007. BETTER THAN NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN!“I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE”"
There Will Be Blood,highest,"Didn’t improve on rewatch and that’s perfectly ok. Got a little bored in the middle section because I remembered all of the stuff that happens but it’s still a sight to behold so I can still visually appreciate it. Fantastic performances from Paul Dano and Daniel Day-Lewis are really what pushes this film into the top tier in my opinion. Now I need to rewatch “No Country for Old Men,” I know it will be just as good as the first time around."

The Assassin,lowest,The most boring film I’ve ever seen.
The Assassin,lowest,"A Wuxia version of In the Mood for Love, it too is over-emphasized substance that’s also vaguely dramatized despite its linger broadcasting its importance. That said, some may see beauty between the disengaged notes here, but I actually wanted music of feelings. There is perhaps no greater emotional apathy in the magic of art than uncomfortable, unneeded, and obvious, drawn-out silence and static mood building."
The Assassin,lowest,"Deliberate andPonderous in plot and shot,I was bored to tears."
The Assassin,lowest,"I feel deceived by the Letterboxd community. I saw this movie here with an ""okay"" rating, and decided to watch... well, I guess this was one of the most boring movies I have ever watched! Ever! Nothing fucking happened! I had to struggle not to fall asleep during the entire movie!"
The Assassin,lowest,"Anyone rating this over 2 stars is a pretentious wanker who thinks he's watched a masterpiece because it's pretty and mindnumbingly dull. The cinematography is actually laughably amateurish, with bad compositions, home video pannings and inexplicably confusing editing. This is nothing but a well-packaged turd."
The Assassin,lowest,"Oui le film est beau et bien filmé mais c'était looooooong j'ai cru vivre un lundi après midi de travail alors qu'il dure 1h30J'ai rien compris au scénario, j'ai failli quitter 3 fois et sans le résumé Letterboxd impossible de savoir la relation des deux persosJ'ai jamais été aussi abattu devant un film sérieux..."

The Assassin,lowest,Vulgar Auteurism at its most pretentious.
The Assassin,lowest,Very very slow - didn't get beyond 20 minutes into it.
The Assassin,lowest,"Boring, please go and see Hero or The House of The Flying Daggers"
The Assassin,lowest,"This would have been wonderful as a Discovery Channel mockumentary of the 9th century Weibo province during the Tang Dynasty. The imagery and cinematography were breathtaking.But it wasn't a mockumentary. It was a movie, they said. It was shown at Cannes, they said.Old people copulate at the speed of light compared to the pacing of this film. Had I prepared ahead of time, I could have bought the Chinese version of the Rosetta Stone software and become fucking…"
The Assassin,lowest,"Beautiful, yes. Interminable, yes. Fast-forwarded the last 45 minutes rather than turn it off and am convinced I missed nothing of importance. The black and white prologue was stunning and then it was a slow, inexorable decline. Don't tease me with wuxia and then cut to an ultra long-shot of a forest, leaving mere glimpses of humans engaging in combat. Rubbish."
The Assassin,highest,"Il y a tellement à dire sur ce film magnifique que je peux pas tout résumer en une seule critiqueC'est juste une oeuvre inépuisable et tellement bellePour mon dernier revisionnage je retiendrai deux choses qui m'ont énormément frappéLa première c'est le parti pris de HHH de ne jamais montrer les moments de liens humains, les scènes où les personnages se retrouvent et s'exprimentIl ne s'intéresse qu'aux conséquences des ces enjeux émotionnels et scénaristiques, qu'au moment des…"
The Assassin,highest,"beautiful and elemental filmmaking to the degree of which i'm not sure i've seen since watching a touch of zen.. love all the images that occur behind smoke, steam, fabric, fog but there's a constant clarity, v psychedelic imo. hubei looks like the most beautiful place in the world"
The Assassin,highest,중화권 감독들에게 있어 무협이라는 장르는 관객을 끌어모으기 위한 스튜디오 장르로서 뿐만이 아니라 민족 문학 혹은 미학을 드러내기 위한 장치였다. 호금전의 경우 일본의 살진을 거부하며 중국의 풍경화로 이를 드러내었고 두기봉의 경우 홍콩이라는 도시의 정체성을 무협의 미학으로 어떻게든 유지하려 하며 같은 식탁에서 밥을 먹는 이방인 조니 할리데이의 모습을 통해 드러내었다. 헌데 허우 샤오시엔의 경우 이는 좀 다르다고 할 수 있다. 물론 이 영화에서 마치 중화권의 풍경화와 같은 서예의 미학이나 위박이라는 지역의 특성으로 대만의 현대사를 드러내려는 시도가 없는 것은 아니다. 오프닝의 흑백 화면은…
The Assassin,highest,"Não dá pra assistir uma única vez, pretendo revisitar em breve.É uma viagem visual e provavelmente a mais bonita que já vi.Wuxia e a novelle vague, juntos, é um rolê que vai ficar martelando a minha cabeça por umbom tempo."
The Assassin,highest,myth whispered across centuries. this is something really incredible.
The Assassin,highest,"The most visually stunning film I've ever seen. The cinematography immerses you so deeply that it feels as though you're stepping into each scene. Every frame is a painting. The attention to detail is incredible, from the visuals to the set design and costumes, all harmoniously crafted to create an unforgettable atmosphere."
The Assassin,highest,it was one of the top 10 films i've ever watched. its a very high-quality production.
The Assassin,highest,"I don’t think that final shot will leave my mind anytime soon. The rest of the movie is really really good as well, all these long calms before incredibly violent and abrupt storm that sometimes just last what feels like a few frames are such a unique and awesome way of telling your average assassin story, and to end it with all with a total rejection of everything, a way out from all this violence and war…"
The Assassin,highest,"Breathtaking. Unparalleled, tbqh maybe one of the best films I've ever seen? I made it forty minutes in and started it over again just because it was just so delicious. Every scene is framed like a painting."
The Assassin,highest,"If you don't lock in when the movie switches to color, then I feel sorry for you. I get that not everyone has the patience to discover that a shot that seems to hold just too long is in fact held for the perfect amount of time. But if you don't lock in when the evil wizard shows up, then I truly don't understand what you want movies to be."
The Assassin,highest,I adore everything about this film
The Assassin,highest,"i tried watching this yesterday after a half day at work and i nearly instantly started to doze off and every moments seems to be going slower and slower, so i stopped and restarted it today. totally different experience, everything in this moves so smoothly and it’s so beautiful. and the editing does anything but lull you because you never know when it will cut right into a fight sequence. like you’ll see that one should be coming then its…"
The Assassin,highest,So damn good! My new favorite Wuxia movie! And that ending song is a banger
The Assassin,highest,"“Your skills are matchless, but your mind is hostage to human sentiments”This is the best looking film I have ever seen. Every single shot is some of the most gorgeously framed and vibrantly colored imagery ever put to screen. It’s definitely not for everyone though. It’s very tedious to get through and has minimal dialogue, which forces you to basically piece together the story yourself. That said, I was still able to be completely absorbed by this and some of those images are going to be seared into my brain forever."
