Interstellar,lowest,"Most overrated movie of all time. People who enjoy this movie get wet when they hear Matthew mcconnahey say Alright Alright Alrighttt.

The Dark Knight,lowest,"CHECK THE DATEhonestly, terrible film. it has an unlikable protagonist, gratuitous violence, shines an unflattering (and undeserved) light on corporate America, glamorizes child abuse, and sends a terrible message to children. is this really the kind of movie we want to be showing the nation's youth? there's already so much violence and death in the world. do we really need to be glorifying it on screen?in short, horrible choice for family movie night. anyone who enjoys this ""film"" is a total monster who should be spit on in the streets."

The Dark Knight,lowest,"As far as movies and superhero adaptations go, this is how you fumble it up 101. You can feel the pretentiousness of Christopher Nolan's vision as he torments the comic book genre and replaces it with his sob crime drama script that gives little to nothing for Batman to accomplish. The way he punches looks like a martial artist using casts for fists. There is also an obvious lack of CGI in the ""practical"" stunts that creates a practically fake‚Ä¶"

Inception,lowest,"Inception is a two-and-a-half-hour TED Talk on dreams disguised as a heist movie that thinks it's way smarter than it actually is. Nolan piles on layers of exposition like he‚Äôs afraid we‚Äôll blink and miss how *deep* it all is, while characters stand around explaining the rules of the dream world like confused tour guides. The emotional core is paper-thin, buried under so much cold, mechanical plotting that even DiCaprio can‚Äôt make you care.

Inception,highest,"The name Christopher Nolan and the concept of'time dilation' has been written in correspondence for over a decade, and this is the genesis of that correlation, Not only was 'Inception' the blueprint of his clock core classics like Interstellar and Tenet, but I believe it was when the notorious director truly hit the mark.

The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,Really disappointed Daniel Day Lewis didn‚Äôt show up
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,"The 1936 version of this film is not only bad but also ludicrously offensive. All of the key Native American characters are played by white actors and the writing is horrendous. So bad that the screenwriter himself, Philip Dunne had nothing but terrible things to say about the film as well, a film he claims was ruined by the studio system's over emphasis on the producer role. Here's what he said:""The film was appalling. In our absence, Eddie (producer)‚Ä¶"
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,"I probably wouldn‚Äôt have watched this if it weren‚Äôt for a viewing in my Native Americans in film class. You can clearly see how much of this story has not aged well at all, and disappointingly, no good representation was given to the people in which the entire film gets its name. Native stereotypes were abundant, no character development, and the writing had extreme plot holes. (also where is the historical accuracy?) After many re-tellings of this story, i don‚Äôt know how to feel knowing this was ‚Äúpeak cinema‚Äù in its time."
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,"*insett George bush being notified about 9/11 meme*""Sir theres been another Mohican"""

The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,i didn‚Äôt want the mohicans to end.
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,Somewhat faithful adaptation that's hard to watch due to white actors playing Native Americans. Randolph Scott was fun to watch giving us a Han Solo version of Hawkeye. I've not yet watched the Michael Mann version but he used this movie as one of his influences so not the best sign.
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,Going from Randolph Scott to Daniel Day-Lewis might be the greatest casting upgrade in cinematic history. It's like settling down to a luxury meal prepared by a Michelin star chef after you've tried munching on Chaplin's boiled shoe fromThe Gold Rush. The quality is galaxies apart.George B. Seitz's 30s adaptation of the classic American tale - its first sound feature film - is a hot mess. It has all of the horrible racist moral core of the 20s‚Ä¶
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,why is there a hundred-fucking-million of these and they all suck ass
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,i can‚Äôt explain it but this movie has millennial pause
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,"Unless you are obsessed with this story, do yourself a favor and just watch the 1992 Michael Mann/DDL version."
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,Some decent battle scenes but overall pretty dull.
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,You know what will blow your mind? How many of this movie have been made.
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,Its melodrama and casual racism has not aged well.
The Last of the Mohicans,lowest,this is marginally better than the 1992 version like that one was just so bad
The Last of the Mohicans,highest,"Yes, I listened to Tarantinos podcast where he gushes about this movie but I was extremely skeptical.I also have not seen the Michael Mann version yet, but this was quite good!Worse part was watching it on plex, horrendous commercials completely took me out of it.Also Randolph Scotts hair style is so bizarre"
The Last of the Mohicans,highest,"I‚Äôd only seen the Michael Mann version and expected this to be less brutal and more racist. ¬†Surprisingly, it‚Äôs neither."

The Last of the Mohicans,highest,"This 2nd adaptation of Last of the Mohicans is pretty good for a mid 1930s film.

The Last of the Mohicans,highest,"Let‚Äôs be clear, Mann‚Äôs adaptation is a masterpiece, but this adaptation is pretty darn good.

The Last of the Mohicans,highest,"Period action adventure The Last of the Mohicans, from 1936, is the fourth Hollywood feature adaptation of the James Fenimore Cooper novel, the first to occur squarely in the center of the Hollywood Golden Age, and independent producer Edward Small packed the academy ratio frame with vivid detail. Production design, staging, editing are superb. Some aspects of production, a tendency towards stasis in camera deployment and casting of non-indigenous thesps in eponymous roles, brand picture as dated. However contemporary aesthetic and moral standards are beseiged and overcome by overall quality of craft."
The Last of the Mohicans,highest,"I'm obsessed with the 1992 version which I believe has more heart to it than this version. But it's pretty good compared to the movies of this time. They do a good job setting the mood during the chase scenes and battles. They show more between col. Munro and gen. Montcalm which I enjoyed their mutual admiration towards eachother.I probably would see it again, but I'm glad I watched it."

The Last King of Scotland,lowest,"Controversial character and great performance fromForest Whitakerbut unfortunately there are some big mistakes, taking into account that the movie does not present reality but is a fictional movie, the white savior was present in this movie and he is the victim, and his mistakes, no matter how big, are justified, rational and very humane. This is very cliche but becoming disgusting more and more when you watch it these days.The political and religious biases that incites hatred were also present in some scenes and this is what spoiled the movie for me."

The Last King of Scotland,lowest,"It should tell you all you need to know that in this film set during Idi Amin‚Äôs reign of terror, the thing that finally makes our imaginary hero draw the line and take action is when he starts making fun of Britain. This is a deeply ignorant film that uses Africans as just a series of interchangeable limbs waiting to be hacked off, every single character is a one dimensional caricature, James McAvoy‚Äôs character is despicable, and although Forest Whitaker is the best thing about the film, his performance is a lot thinner than its reputation suggests. He sounds like Eddie Murphy in Coming To America."
The Last King of Scotland,lowest,"I really hope that we‚Äôve progressed far enough to make sure that a movie like this isn‚Äôt ever made again... this film does absolutely no service to the stories of the underrepresented.

John Wick,highest,"Until it was shown to me, I obviously had never seen the film before. I was able to guess why John Wick was going to do whatever he ended up doing in the movie within ten minutes. My friend was shocked, pausing the movie and asking if I had seen it beforehand. I had not. However, being on point about the beginning and rest of the movie shocked me. Maybe I've seen too many films? Regardless, I got a chuckle from the guessing experience.Loved the movie, would watch again."
