The Assassin,lowest,"A Wuxia version of In the Mood for Love, it too is over-emphasized substance thatâ€™s also vaguely dramatized despite its linger broadcasting its importance. That said, some may see beauty between the disengaged notes here, but I actually wanted music of feelings. There is perhaps no greater emotional apathy in the magic of art than uncomfortable, unneeded, and obvious, drawn-out silence and static mood building.",negative,a wuxia version of in the mood for love it too is over emphasized substance that s also vaguely dramatized despite its linger broadcasting its importance that said some may see beauty between the disengaged notes here but i actually wanted music of feelings there is perhaps no greater emotional apathy in the magic of art than uncomfortable unneeded and obvious drawn out silence and static mood building

The Assassin,lowest,"Beautiful, yes. Interminable, yes. Fast-forwarded the last 45 minutes rather than turn it off and am convinced I missed nothing of importance.

The Assassin,highest,"â€œYour skills are matchless, but your mind is hostage to human sentimentsâ€This is the best looking film I have ever seen. Every single shot is some of the most gorgeously framed and vibrantly colored imagery ever put to screen. Itâ€™s definitely not for everyone though. Itâ€™s very tedious to get through and has minimal dialogue, which forces you to basically piece together the story yourself. That said, I was still able to be completely absorbed by this and some of those images are going to be seared into my brain forever.",positive,your skills are matchless but your mind is hostage to human sentiments this is the best looking film i have ever seen every single shot is some of the most gorgeously framed and vibrantly colored imagery ever put to screen it s definitely not for everyone though it s very tedious to get through and has minimal dialogue which forces you to basically piece together the story yourself that said i was still able to be completely absorbed by this and some of those images are going to be seared into my brain forever
