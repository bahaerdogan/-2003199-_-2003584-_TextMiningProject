A Hijacking,lowest,"I'm not sure you could have done less, or made a less compelling film about a hijacking. It's not gripping, it's not compelling, it's just dull and often very frustrating. I wasn't shocked to find out that Tobias Lindholm wrote (and directed) this film, having pennedThe Huntas well.There is rarely any emotion, little acting required and with almost four months at sea and very little food, the crew never seemed to lose weight at all.

A Hijacking,highest,"People from Scandinavian countries make cool movies. ie: Sweden's Let The Right One In. This atypical sea-bound hostage thriller is from Denmark. It's Captain Phillips but with more boardrooms and less Tom Hanks. The film cuts back and forth between the events on a hijacked ship and the hostage negotiation process back on land. The two main guys, the ship's cook and the head corporate dude, are great. Sounds mad boring, but is instead scary and tense.",negative

A Hijacking,highest,"This is a film about a cargo ship that is attacked by Somali pirates and the negotiations with the ship's company in Copenhagen.

A Hijacking,highest,"Harrowing but gripping tale focusing on the negotiations for the release of a hijacked container ship. The tension just ratchets up, you feel like you are in the room scared of how the hijackers will react. You can also feel the desparation of the hostages and the isolation they feel when they hear that their bosses won't just pay the money. You can see them slowly degrade and dehumanise as time goes on. An excellent film, all the better for ignoring the action of the hijacking itself and delving into the psychological torture of those on the ship and those back home.",positive
A Hijacking,highest,"A suspenseful film about the hijacking of a cargo ship by Somali pirates. Unlike captain Phillips, this film focusses on the negotiation with the Danish CEO.

This is a single-location movie similar to such films like Phone Booth, Buried & Locke; the latter being used as the most obvious comparison as the film…",negative
The Guilty,lowest,Thrillers work mostly due to a threat to their featured protagonist. Cortes' Buried is tense because Reynolds is buried alive and tries not to die. It's not just about resisting death. But... WE CARE! The threats here are happening not to the character seen on screen. And we don't connect to them dramatically because of the mystery. They are even a total stranger! An idea destined to flounder. And it does!,negative

The Invitation,highest,"“The Invitation” begins as a seemingly innocuous dinner party but quickly transforms into a slow-burn thriller that probes deeply into grief, trauma, and the dangers of conformity. The film’s brilliance lies in its ability to evoke unease through quiet moments and subtle tension. Kusama’s direction is meticulous, using the claustrophobic setting to amplify the paranoia. The slow revelation of the guests' motives and the tension-filled atmosphere lead to an utterly chilling climax. ""The Invitation"" is a masterclass in psychological horror, leaving you questioning your own perceptions and choices. An unsettling exploration of human nature at its darkest.",negative

The Assassin,lowest,the only thing she actually assassinated was my will to live.,positive
The Assassin,lowest,The most boring film I’ve ever seen.,negative
The Assassin,lowest,"A Wuxia version of In the Mood for Love, it too is over-emphasized substance that’s also vaguely dramatized despite its linger broadcasting its importance. That said, some may see beauty between the disengaged notes here, but I actually wanted music of feelings. There is perhaps no greater emotional apathy in the magic of art than uncomfortable, unneeded, and obvious, drawn-out silence and static mood building.",positive
The Assassin,lowest,"Deliberate andPonderous in plot and shot,I was bored to tears.",negative
The Assassin,lowest,"I feel deceived by the Letterboxd community. I saw this movie here with an ""okay"" rating, and decided to watch... well, I guess this was one of the most boring movies I have ever watched! Ever! Nothing fucking happened! I had to struggle not to fall asleep during the entire movie!",negative
The Assassin,lowest,"Anyone rating this over 2 stars is a pretentious wanker who thinks he's watched a masterpiece because it's pretty and mindnumbingly dull. The cinematography is actually laughably amateurish, with bad compositions, home video pannings and inexplicably confusing editing. This is nothing but a well-packaged turd.",negative
The Assassin,lowest,Very very slow - didn't get beyond 20 minutes into it.,negative
The Assassin,lowest,"Boring, please go and see Hero or The House of The Flying Daggers",negative
The Assassin,lowest,"This would have been wonderful as a Discovery Channel mockumentary of the 9th century Weibo province during the Tang Dynasty. The imagery and cinematography were breathtaking.But it wasn't a mockumentary. It was a movie, they said. It was shown at Cannes, they said.Old people copulate at the speed of light compared to the pacing of this film. Had I prepared ahead of time, I could have bought the Chinese version of the Rosetta Stone software and become fucking…",positive
The Assassin,lowest,"Beautiful, yes. Interminable, yes. Fast-forwarded the last 45 minutes rather than turn it off and am convinced I missed nothing of importance. The black and white prologue was stunning and then it was a slow, inexorable decline. Don't tease me with wuxia and then cut to an ultra long-shot of a forest, leaving mere glimpses of humans engaging in combat. Rubbish.",positive
The Assassin,highest,"beautiful and elemental filmmaking to the degree of which i'm not sure i've seen since watching a touch of zen.. love all the images that occur behind smoke, steam, fabric, fog but there's a constant clarity, v psychedelic imo. hubei looks like the most beautiful place in the world",positive
The Assassin,highest,myth whispered across centuries. this is something really incredible.,positive
The Assassin,highest,"The most visually stunning film I've ever seen. The cinematography immerses you so deeply that it feels as though you're stepping into each scene. Every frame is a painting. The attention to detail is incredible, from the visuals to the set design and costumes, all harmoniously crafted to create an unforgettable atmosphere.",positive
The Assassin,highest,it was one of the top 10 films i've ever watched. its a very high-quality production.,positive
The Assassin,highest,"I don’t think that final shot will leave my mind anytime soon. The rest of the movie is really really good as well, all these long calms before incredibly violent and abrupt storm that sometimes just last what feels like a few frames are such a unique and awesome way of telling your average assassin story, and to end it with all with a total rejection of everything, a way out from all this violence and war…",positive
The Assassin,highest,"Breathtaking. Unparalleled, tbqh maybe one of the best films I've ever seen? I made it forty minutes in and started it over again just because it was just so delicious. Every scene is framed like a painting.",positive
The Assassin,highest,"If you don't lock in when the movie switches to color, then I feel sorry for you. I get that not everyone has the patience to discover that a shot that seems to hold just too long is in fact held for the perfect amount of time. But if you don't lock in when the evil wizard shows up, then I truly don't understand what you want movies to be.",negative
The Assassin,highest,I adore everything about this film,neutral
The Assassin,highest,"i tried watching this yesterday after a half day at work and i nearly instantly started to doze off and every moments seems to be going slower and slower, so i stopped and restarted it today. totally different experience, everything in this moves so smoothly and it’s so beautiful. and the editing does anything but lull you because you never know when it will cut right into a fight sequence. like you’ll see that one should be coming then its…",positive
The Assassin,highest,So damn good! My new favorite Wuxia movie! And that ending song is a banger,positive
The Assassin,highest,"“Your skills are matchless, but your mind is hostage to human sentiments”This is the best looking film I have ever seen. Every single shot is some of the most gorgeously framed and vibrantly colored imagery ever put to screen. It’s definitely not for everyone though. It’s very tedious to get through and has minimal dialogue, which forces you to basically piece together the story yourself. That said, I was still able to be completely absorbed by this and some of those images are going to be seared into my brain forever.",positive
