Interstellar,sigh ya‚Äôll were right about this movie.
Interstellar,There is nothing I dislike about this movie. I want a daughter.
Interstellar,‚ÄúIt was me Murph. I was your ghost.‚Äùjust throw me in a black hole at this point

Interstellar,mrs grover putting me onto the good movies
Interstellar,"Jessica Chastain drops the most legendary line:""Hey dad... you son of a bitch.""Forget saving the world or time travel. The real drama is her dad vanishing for decades and then popping out of a 5D bookshelf. 10/10 moment."
Interstellar,"one of those movies where a mobile screen, or any screen that doesnt cover your entire field of view doesnt do this movie any justice. i'm so moved everytime i watch it"

Interstellar,"Track 14 - Detach5:30, is the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever heard"
Interstellar,Just finished watching it loved it too 5 very long but so so so good
Interstellar,Almost every single human I have personally met hates this movie.My family hated it. My wife hated it. My friends hated it. My in-laws hated it. Every random person I‚Äôve ever talked to about movies? Hated it. I cannot think of any movie I‚Äôve seen that is collectively disliked by so many I‚Äôve met.And thenI see the high rating on Letterboxd. Wtaf? Is this a psy-op? Is big sci-fi lying about how good this movie is? Do‚Ä¶
Interstellar,"I find that I am often intrigued by this genre(?) of science-fiction realism where the mathematical and probable outcome is possible, if far-fetched. There is an entertaining display of thought-provoking ideas and concepts though I felt nothing more. The reliance on finding an answer to Cooper‚Äôs expedition could not pass through to resonate with my emotions and I desperatelywantedto care. For as lovely and beautiful as the visuals and soundtrack are, I would rather watch an episode of NOVA or visit a planetarium."
Interstellar,Honestly it's imperfect but it's a favorite for me... It just resonates
Interstellar,"Perfect, I've never seen a movie address quantum mechanics in such a faithful way, and despite all the scientific discussion it still has a ""simple"" meaning: love between father and daughter. I repeat, perfect movie."
Interstellar,This movie is so good I would give it a MILLION stars. The plot twist during the movie was crazy to me and I didn‚Äôt expect it at ALL. Honestly the soundtrack was amazing and the concept of space and wormholes was so cool. It was was also very very sad I cried while watching‚òπÔ∏è anyway I loved Murph btw she was so intelligent. Cooper and TARS were so funny. This movie also made me realize that time is truly just a concept and it really isn‚Äôt as long as we think. Overall so good
Interstellar,Second watch was exponentially better than the first.
The Dark Knight,So the man that freaked me out and had me at the edge of my seat is Patrick Verona!!?!??
The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance is potentially one of the greatest of all time. Mix it in with great special effects, twists and turns, grit and action, and I think you might have a perfect movie."
The Dark Knight,"Truly a great movie. So well directed and the story is very good, too. The opening sequence is perhaps the best made heist in film history. Not as complex as an Ocean's 11 or Inside Man, but so perfectly executed, right down to the mask reference to The Killing."
The Dark Knight,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunityTo seize everything you ever wanted in one momentWould you capture it or just let it slip?"
The Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan‚Äôs The Dark Knight is a cinematic triumph that transcends the superhero genre. From its gripping narrative to its jaw-dropping performances, this film is a work of art that redefines the superhero movie.Christian Bale‚Äôs portrayal of Batman is as intense and layered as ever, but it is Heath Ledger‚Äôs iconic performance as the Joker that elevates this film to legendary status. His chilling, anarchic energy dominates every scene, creating one of the most memorable villains in movie history.‚Ä¶"
The Dark Knight,hate batman in this but every scene with joker heath ledger and maggie gyllenhaal saved it
The Dark Knight,"heath ledger's performance as the joker is so phenomenal, i legit just could not look away."

The Dark Knight,"‚ÄúSuperhero movie‚Äù is probably one of my least favorite genres out there, to be honest. Was never really a fan of DC nor Marvel. The Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy is perhaps the only exception. Until now.The Dark Knight was fantastic. It unexpectedly surpassed my expectations, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I thought that Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker was gonna be the only good thing this movie has to offer, but jesus, the whole movie was just so good."
The Dark Knight,28th April be with you happy superhero day the greatest superhero of all the time goatmanRagnar o batman 3mkom
The Dark Knight,minus a half star because they missed the opportunity for the joker to say ‚Äúyou wanna know how i got these bars?‚Äù and engage in a rap battle with batman
The Dark Knight,"One of the best movies of the DC universe, Christopher Nolan is a genius."
The Dark Knight,forever one of my favourite films ever. a masterpiece in every way. rip heath ledger you king

The Dark Knight,One of my favorite movies of all time so I am happy to finally review it on this app.It had been a few years since I had watched this movie in its entirety. I used to watch the joker scenes repeatedly on YouTube and I think that made me view the movie as more disconnected in the past. It was nice to watch it all again and see how ‚Äúahead of the curve‚Äù the joker was the entire time.‚Ä¶
The Dark Knight,How did harvey dent not know it was the joker until he took off his face mask
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight as a complete film was not as incredible as Heath Ledger was by himself. The movie didn‚Äôt allow enough time for certain scenes to breathe and didn‚Äôt feel as complete as Batman Begins did. With that being said I have it on par with Batman Begins because Ledger‚Äôs joker was utter perfection.
The Dark Knight,best adaption of batman and the joker FIGHT ME
The Dark Knight,loveeee this one! amazing villains
The Dark Knight,I‚Äôd smash majority of the men in this except for harvey EW
Inception,"Did not fully understand what was going on when I first watched it in the cinema, but now I get it‚Ä¶ what a great movie!"
Inception,"Finally I can partake in the discussion. I presume most enjoy Nolan‚Äôs passion with dimensions, time, and the space that he incorporates into his stories. That in my opinion is the most pure representation of his signature or fingerprint in a film. Personally what has accumulated to compel me to discuss Nolan in conversations and my personal headspace as a talented director is his visual effects with physics.Visually Inception is stunning. I am not a movie buff, but the creative‚Ä¶"
Inception,what if we're all NPCs inside another person's dream
Inception,Gotta be one of my favorite movies
Inception,"oh good, now im scared leo dicaprio will manipulate me thru my dreamsüò®"
Inception,"stop right now. i was screaming ‚ÄúFALL FALL FALL BITCH FALL‚Äù at the end i‚Äôm not even kidding.i get that the point of the last scene is that cobb doesn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs reunited with his children and thats all he wanted, but i can‚Äôt help feeling disappointed that if it really is a dream, cobb is okay with leaving his real children in reality and living with projections instead. that is why i choose to believe he's in reality, that he escaped the dream, and that he is with his real children at last."
Inception,when you need therapy but you‚Äôre a man
Inception,I don‚Äôt care about the dead wife I‚Äôm sorry
Inception,GOD DAMNIT WHAT WAS THE ENDING NOLAN U CRAZY FUCK I'MA FIND UUU.(And Cillian Murphy and then plant and idea to marry me) I MEAN WHAT

Inception,Joseph Gordon Levitt doing a little Troy Bolton I see
Inception,"I started this on december last year and was so close to the ending..i don‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt finish this, it‚Äôs so good."
Inception,Sad I can‚Äôt use saying that I‚Äôve never seen this as a party trick anymore
Inception,Oh my god i just watched this properly and holy fuck. saw hans zimmer play 'time' last night in sydney and the tears are flowing
Inception,"""in my dreams we're still together"""
Inception,The complexity of this movie is crazy
Lord of War,"It‚Äôs true, a gun never killed anybody.‚Ä¶ we should blame the individual that aimed and pulled the trigger.It‚Äôs also true that without constant death, the market for guns would be obsolete.thoughts and prayersdon‚Äôt mean anything when the industry continues to arm evil individuals, and financially corrupt politicians. At bare minimum they‚Äôre ¬†enabling killing."
Lord of War,my beloved ethan hawke is goated
Lord of War,The pacing was a little off and a lot of the dialogue felt stunted but overall good movie. Having Cage be an unreliable narrator was a very good move. Ending felt rushed (probably not intentional) and dissatisfying (definitely intentional). It especially stings since the real guy Cage‚Äôs character is based on got released in a prisoner swap for WNBA legend Brittney Griner. At least Jared Leto died in it.
Lord of War,very prototypical 2000s stimmy realistic fiction movie
Lord of War,"This movie was so uninteresting to me that i got halfway through before i realized i had already watched it a few years ago. the movie is so blandly nihilistic that it can't even fully commit to its own brand of self-important nihilism. felt like trying to chew through cardboard. half a star because some of the individual scenes character moments were, i guess, creative."
Lord of War,Thought this was a bio pic at first so that made it super cool and much more tense. A little cliche at times but alas cause it rules
Lord of War,I noticed that some of the characters Donny seem to age over 20 years.
Lord of War,Got to be the most unrealistic family ever
Lord of War,"Unique plot, amazing narrator and good way to weave a political message into your story. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
Lord of War,i wouldve been a crazy weapons merchant
Lord of War,A movie I liked more than I thought I would. It‚Äôs a movie about Yuri‚Äôs descent into dehumanization before he regains a consciousness of sorts and feels the gravity of the situation he put himself within. A film that captivated me from start to finish; I found that I was more invested in Yuri‚Äôs character growth and what would happen to him than a lot of other characters in a moral grey realm like him. It‚Äôs a fantastically real story‚Ä¶
Lord of War,"too many one liners to choose from, fuck ethan hawke little nerd"
Lord of War,"A very Scorsese-esque movie here and one that I actually liked at that: maybe a little too reverent at times, but I use that comparison favourably for the most part; Nic Cage also puts in one of his more understated and as a result, better performances here aswell and writer-director Andrew Niccol spins a brilliant cautionary tale on the weapons trade despite how some of his characters (though developed fairly well) might only serve as a mouthpiece for his message in this movie. As a whole, however, it's good, solid filmmaking with a noble story to tell."
Lord of War,"Great editing and camera work, underwhelming narrative.The film stuffs so much plot in it‚Äôs 122 minute runtime that there is no room to for proper characterization and theme development. Both aspects of the film remain flat and cartoonish.Juri‚Äôs wife is an idealized princess straight out of a disney film. His brother is a one trick pony who‚Äôs constantly coked out and horny, until the plot forces him to become a martyr. Juri‚Äòs parents are props, used to verbalize‚Ä¶"
Lord of War,"i could tell you the plot from the first 5 minutes, but dtill good"
Lord of War,One of my comfort movies I think? First time seeing it on the 4K disc.

Lord of War,"Nicolas Cage walked as the ""Lord of War"" so Jonah Hill could run in ""War Dogs"""
Lord of War,"Great and though provoking movie about asshole. This film is what i call dark comedy. First you laugh, but later you're sad when you realize all the disturbing facts behind the jokes."
The Zone of Interest,"Fascism is a sickness brought on by pathetic men that use power to fuel their pathetic lack of self worth. Rampant propaganda and dogma distract the masses and inoculate them to the violent horrors inherent to fascists. To this family the horrors that echo from the Auschwitz death is a part of their routine, a regular feature in their neighborhood ambiance. Any screams are from the subhumans.Nazis aren‚Äôt some otherworldly creatures that came down and just decided to do‚Ä¶"
The Zone of Interest,chillingly uncomfortable watch. boring but needed to be.

The Zone of Interest,"This is not grim enough for a movie about the holocaust, yet it is so very grim. Felt like a horror movie about a real life monster"
The Zone of Interest,Shows the horrors in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù family setting. What was even most unsettling was watching this movie after being to Auschwitz and seeing the horrors committed and where H√∂ss‚Äôs house would‚Äôve been and knowing he would‚Äôve seen the atrocities. Insane but very well made
The Zone of Interest,extremely effective film. trusting that the audience can keep up. i've seen people call it 'horrific in its mundanity' since it premiered and. yep.
The Zone of Interest,‚Äòeverything we want on our doorstep‚Äôwhat a mass genocide???
The Zone of Interest,i dont know how to describe this. i really dont. the emotions i have felt i never felt before. it has horrifying but knowing it is the reality is way more terrifying than the actual thing
The Zone of Interest,I will watch Sandra H√ºller in anything.
The Zone of Interest,"One of the best films of 2023 and fully deserving of its nomination for Best Picture and its wins for Best International and Best Sound in particular. No movie has made me feel so abhorred for its subjects for their apathy and disregard for human life. Though you never see their victims, they were real people, just like you and I, and the choice of the film makers to never portray them in the film is a reflection of the‚Ä¶"
The Zone of Interest,"Chilling, suffocating, and brutally restrained ‚Äî The Zone of Interest is a masterclass in showing horror without showing it. Glazer‚Äôs detached, almost clinical approach makes the evil feel even more monstrous, embedding it into the everyday rhythms of a ""normal"" life. The sound design does half the heavy lifting, and it‚Äôs terrifying in ways that visuals could never achieve. Christian Friedel and Sandra H√ºller are hauntingly ordinary, which is exactly the point. It‚Äôs not an easy watch, but it‚Äôs essential, and it lingers long after the credits roll like a sickness you can‚Äôt shake."
The Zone of Interest,this dude used to makesexy beastso i feel like that tells you something about howyou‚Äôremeant to be feeling walking around every day
The Zone of Interest,"this is a horror movie. And I completely get why they gave it the Best Sound Academy Award, sounds in the movie are so crucial and so disturbing that makes you focus that we are thinking about what's on the orher side of the wall. Its one of the best movies I've seen, and its as terrifying and horrible as its majestic. Pretty relevant to see how there are other zones of interest in the present day."
The Zone of Interest,"So deep into war movies, I might never return üß†ü™ñüêà‚Äç‚¨õ"
The Zone of Interest,"Did not think I‚Äôd find the basic day to day of an SS family interesting but here we are. Just amazing sound and cinematography never showing the horrors of the concentration camps was a great choice just showing how terrible this place was, but without seeing anything but knowing all this terrible things are happening."

The Zone of Interest,Absolutely haunting but important to watch
Moneyball,The metaphor at the end of the movie is so genius and a good way to finish telling the underlying story of Beane‚Äôs battle with his thoughts.
Moneyball,"""Billy, this is Chad Bradford. He's a relief pitcher. He's one of the most undervalued players in baseball. His defect is that he throws funny‚Ä¶‚ÄùGets me going!One of my favorite comfort movies."

Moneyball,That felt like it made for much better viewing that in was supposed to
Moneyball,Still have no idea why people watch baseball but it was pretty cool nonetheless.
Moneyball,Brad Pitt‚Äôs best performance. One of my favorite sports movies. Immensely entertaining.
Moneyball,Kinda wild to think that they Thought they gut feeling was better than maths and stats lol
Moneyball,"‚ÄúWe lost‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only been a few days. Give yourself some time to get over it‚Äù‚ÄúMan I don‚Äôt get over these things. Ever.‚ÄùSame Billy Beane, same‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On another note, very good movie. I‚Äôll watch 50 baseball movies before I‚Äôll watch one full baseball game."
Moneyball,EVERY TIME. Oh my gosh this movie is the most heartwarming story every and I watched on a plane this time.
Moneyball,"Wish this movie would've been confident enough in itself to stay focused on what's interesting here: the GM's career, his evolving strategy, his relationship with the team, the tensions he holds between data science + superstition, the little weirdo Jonah Hill plays, It really didn't need all the extra fluff about his past and his family. Brad Pitt brings so much to this - it's just a joy watching him as this character."
Moneyball,"Billy is still trying to win the last game of the season.What I love about this movie is a naive marxist teenager could probably put on their ‚Äúthinking cap‚Äù and derive that this movie is some class conscious critique of the billionaire thing. Or a cautionary tale of the digital revolution. But no, it‚Äôs literally just about baseball.‚ÄúHow can you not be romantic about baseball‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a metaphor‚Äù‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a metaphor‚ÄùExcept it‚Äôs not. He doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
Moneyball,watched like 1 game of baseball ever but how can you not be romantic about it.
Moneyball,How can you not be romantic about baseball. Plus the daughter‚Äôs song is a banger. Great film
Moneyball,"Mei Lu put this on last night, and though I‚Äôve probably seen this in its entirety around 5-10 times, I still sat there and watched it through.Loved the Zaillian parts of the script. The Sorkin rewrites are quite obvious and are, to no surprise, very Sorkin-y. Danna‚Äôs score still hits and the general look and pace of everything is still captivating and retain that timeless quality that makes it so rewatch-ableNever recognized scumbag Activision CEO Bobby Kotick and Spike Jonze were in this too, so that was a surprising aspect of this rewatch."
Moneyball,"Great acting, good insight to realism of the behind the scenes in sport, a bit boring at certain stages, but overall a very good watch"

Moneyball,Fucking spectacularI can‚Äôt believe they made baseball and statistics this interesting

Moneyball,"5 star movie, -1 for being horribly inaccurate"
The Last of the Mohicans,"This was discussed on the most recent episode of the Video Archives podcast, which got me intrigued to see this. I‚Äôve never seen any adaptation of this material before. This is the 1936 version, starring Randolph Scott as Hawkeye.This film has everything: fully realized characters, who I was totally invested in, several competing factions, all with their reasons, a great depiction (both positively and negatively) of military codes of honor and duty and lots and lots of action."
The Last of the Mohicans,"If I didn't fell in love with the Mann version years ago, this could be my favourite ""the last of the mohicans"" picture. They made a bunch of them since the silent era. This one, class 1936, holds the test of time, except for the deaths by firearm that are kind of silly, but having say that what a gorgeous film that Seitz pull out of this ever green story. Randalph Scott as Hawkeye gives han solo vibes to his‚Ä¶"
The Last of the Mohicans,Watched due to the Video Archives Podcast.
The Last of the Mohicans,"Although not the first on-screen adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's iconic 1826 novel, its clear that many of the future tellings of this tale owe a great deal to this George B. Seitz work, which features a younger Randolph Scott as the central Hawkeye, a scout who is tasked with escorting two daughters of Colonel Monroe safely through the brutal French and Native American War.A leaner, more adventurous take on the story than many of the other cinematic adaptions,‚Ä¶"
The Last of the Mohicans,"Yes, I listened to Tarantinos podcast where he gushes about this movie but I was extremely skeptical.I also have not seen the Michael Mann version yet, but this was quite good!Worse part was watching it on plex, horrendous commercials completely took me out of it.Also Randolph Scotts hair style is so bizarre"
The Last of the Mohicans,"Randolph Scott isn't Daniel Day-Lewis, but he is still Randolph Scott. The man's endlessly watchable. The film felt a lot longer than the runtime suggested. It's rather slow and flat in its delivery way more than it needs to be."
The Last of the Mohicans,"Yes I realize I rated this higher than the Mann version, and yes it‚Äôs not better, but I need to rewatch it first."
The Last of the Mohicans,It‚Äôs so violent and it moves so fast. However if you've seen the Michael Manm version you will constantly be comparing it. Randolph Scott is pretty good but he‚Äôs dressed like Davy Crocket.
The Last of the Mohicans,this is marginally better than the 1992 version like that one was just so bad
The Last of the Mohicans,"I found director George Seitz and editor Harry Marker continually undercutting what few good scenes there are, the Fort Henry attack, the dramatic cliff deaths,Duncan‚Äòs heroic gambit, old native women mutilatingHawkeyesgenitalia, very frustrating for a film I was trying desperately to lock in to. (Note: all of those happen in the last 30 minutes of the film)Clearly I‚Äôm not as taken with this story as others.*Randy Scott‚Äôs long wavy hair is sexy asfuck.**Skinny Bruce Cabot asMaguain a Mohawk bald cap, less so."
The Last of the Mohicans,Thanks to the Video Archives Podcast for the recommendation.
The Last of the Mohicans,"Pulpy with lots of action, but white Randolph Scott's Hawkeye leads the charge through fights and chases. The fight choreography is rudimentary, the film maintains a consistent level of energy."
The Last of the Mohicans,"1st Movie in the Video Archives episode where American frontier adventure is definitely a theme.The other two, Northwest Passage and Kit Carson, were both decent as was this version of Last of the Mohicans.I do love the story but the lighting is strange and of course the camera framing is old fashioned and there are several blue-eyed Indians.But it was decent. This is the first Video Archives episode where I do not have a clear favourite.All OK."
The Last of the Mohicans,Will the real Hawkeye please stand up?
The Last of the Mohicans,i didn‚Äôt want the mohicans to end.
The Last of the Mohicans,Watching anyone in this films acting as they get shot is pure comedy.
The Last of the Mohicans,could barely hear and racist BOOOOOO
The Last of the Mohicans,"Breezy, if somewhat unremarkable adaptation of the classic novel."
The Last of the Mohicans,"I read Jane Austen‚Äôs Persuasion in college, and I don‚Äôt remember much, but the protagonist‚Äôs father has always stuck with me. A pathetic character who preferred to immerse himself in the past rather than face the reality of his present. Anyway, I‚Äôve been really digging old movies recently for some reason."
The Last of the Mohicans,A relentless entertainment machine.
The Last of the Mohicans,"This pleasantly surprised me. Initially, I had reservations about the casting choices, as the two main actors seemed too similar. However, as the story unfolded, I realized that this was actually a clever decision. The plot captivated me from start to finish, and I was particularly drawn to the breathtaking cliff-top scene, which evoked memories of the classic film ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" While the acting didn't reach extraordinary heights, it still held its own. I couldn't help‚Ä¶"
The Last of the Mohicans,why is there a hundred-fucking-million of these and they all suck ass

Sicario,"I loved this one just as much as the more famous Sicario (same thing happened with the two different movies that happen to be titled Moonlight). For me, the plight of the main protagonist captured my attention immediately and I was wholly enthralled by everything about him and what he goes through. Amazing stuff."

Sicario,messy low budget narco drama/action from colombia that somehow grabs your attention throughout
Sicario,"Good rags to riches crime flick, but lacking some of the flourishes I felt it needed to make it great. It got boring at times and dragged on a little, especially w everything being so realistically action based. That being said, the set design was solid."
Sicario,"One of the first films I watched when I started my journey to learn Spanish. Its Raw, violent and has special place in my heart."
Sicario,the random ass punk show fight was bomb

The Hangover,"Alan Fucking DiesPretty good, really enjoyed most of the jokes and the plot is entertaining enough.Alan is the most annoying character by far and takes away from most of jokes as they just go on too long.

Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"Jumping through a lightening storm is genuinely insane shit.I think its tough for a spy thriller to do much better than this: high stakes, phenomenal stunts/action sequences, a compelling love interest, and a cast if familiar and empathetic recurrijg characters in a beautiful and far away locations.

Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"This is the pinnacle of action movies, I fear.Mission: Impossible - Falloutputs the central theme of the franchise on full display.

Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"Was switching throughout the whole movie whether my favourite is Fallout or Dead Reckoning. Then the 3rd act hits and as good as Dead Reckoning that final act is all time, the helicopter chase in unbelievable, the mountain range visuals, hand to hand combat is all super tight. Remarkable that just as we‚Äôre coming to an end of this series we‚Äôre getting top tier films.Julia is talking to Ethan at the end about how she can sleep well at night knowing Ethan is always looking out for here and the rest of us and that‚Äôs how I feel about Cruise.

Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"A friend of mine put this on because they loved it and wanted to show me. I tried. I really did.

The Game,The remedy for the fear caused by persecutory delusions is to embrace the absurdity of it all.
The Game,"By the end of the movie, you just want some kind of consequence for Van Orten, but the ending really says that this is just how life is for the wealthy; there are no consequences because you have the ultimate get out of jail free card. I feel like for anyone else, this would have been a crash-course therapy session but I doubt anything will actually stick for this guy and he's going to go back to being a cold-hearted, self-isolating asshole when he rolls out of bed the next morning."
The Game,"The middle third is so good, but it just didn't have the juice to finish the job. You approach the end and realize that there really wasn't many ways this could end, which reduces the tension and really makes you think about how it's just about a bunch of rich people spending stupid amounts of money to trick each other"
The Game,The Clown/TV scene is absolutely horrifying and I wish it kept more of that nightmarish and lonesome energy throughout.Very experimental by Fincher to just keep adding third act after third act after third act.
The Game,"My brain just got purple nurpled for 2 hours straight, and you think it would get used to the twists after 30 minutes and then BAM another one. This movie reminds me of Vanilla Sky in that you never know when you are in the game or not. Now I will constantly contemplate if I‚Äôm playing the game. I can‚Äôt believe it took me 22 years to find this MASTERPIECE. This is Cinema."
The Game,Take a drink every time a new female character is introduced. Enjoy your three drinks!This is a fun movie but even as an idiot teenager I knew the ending sucked shit.

The Game,It‚Äôs a Wonderful Lifefor sickos
The Game,"This is the type of movie you can literally only watch once just based on the rug pull aspect of it. Not the greatest pull tho because the main character just lacks character and not the craziest suprise like nothing profound came of it as a viewer, good suspense like SAW vibes but no payoff"
The Game,Brilliant ending. The foreshadowing was crazy. Definitely keeps you guessing.
The Game,That dog has a fire pair of shoes now
The Game,"Great film as usual from Fincher.The acting from Michael Douglas is on another level. The build up is fantastic. But the ending threw me off. I would've preferred the tragic outcome before the final twist to be the defined ending. It felt too happy like. Everything else was great in other than that. It was definitely up there with ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" for me to a point. Also, I couldn't help but notice that this film‚Ä¶"
The Game,"It's just a prank bro, chillax."
The Game,i think the brother is the one who needs help- a man can be rich and boring if he wants at least he‚Äôs not a psychopath?
The Game,i realized i‚Äôve seen this movie before. during the last scene.
The Game,"Still fire, pace is a bit slow in 1st act, but the acting and direction are great and the story is original."
The Game,"This is just so stupid, the ending especially."
The Game,"This movie feels like one big prank once you reach the conclusion, but until then you‚Äôre sitting on the edge of your seat trying to process everything that‚Äôs happening. This deserves another watch in the future."
The Game,"I want this for my 48th birthday.Dude there‚Äôs movies you watch with some people and they say ‚Äòwhat is happening?‚Äô every other scene even when it‚Äôs like the movie is explaining things and going slow, and those people just don‚Äôt get it, somehow.

Toy Story 4,"Didn't think they could pull it off‚Äîand then they broke me. Gorgeous animation, perfect character arcs, and an ending that feels brave and bittersweet. Woody‚Äôs journey deserved this. Nearly goddam perfect"
Toy Story 4,"Unnecessary, unexpected but it‚Äôs good"
Toy Story 4,"Such a hard film to rate considering the context behind it. I don‚Äôt think this is an unnecessary sequel because it‚Äôs a cash-grab. The story has meaning in it. My problem comes to how this undermines the conclusion of three. The arc that spanned 1 through 3 was wrapped up beautifully. This opens that arc back up which doesn‚Äôt feel necessary. However, I do think the story opens the book of these characters once last time to give a massive‚Ä¶"
Toy Story 4,I didn‚Äôt think this movie was necessary because the 3rd movie was a perfect way to end the franchise. Seeing how Hollywood/Disney/Pixar can‚Äôt come up with original movies anymore these days they keep making these movies. It was interesting seeing how Woody transitioned from being Andy‚Äôs toy to Bonnie‚Äôs to living out in the streets with Bo Peep. He was made to be Andy‚Äôs toy I feel. He didn‚Äôt quite fit with Bonnie and I think that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt really get played with a lot. I‚Äôm glad he found Bo and found a new purpose in his life.
Toy Story 4,they NEEDED to show that they improved in animation since ‚Äò95 i guess

Toy Story 4,woody really chose a girl from 9 years ago over all his friends
Toy Story 4,This is pretty much tied for me for best Toy Story movie. The story from the third is the best one but this is the funniest one for sure. The plush rush scene is such a funny scene.

Toy Story 4,"i really liked this one! Woody's character specifically, i think the thing that got me is that he is actually playing the role of the 'movie cowboy' and the plot kind of follows in that way with the kid he has to protect, old flame, sacrifice, saying your goodbyes. I think it was really well handled and I also really like the villain redemption. Just a very good time and visually looked amazing especially with lighting that at times felt kind of like James Mangold dramatic"

The Last King of Scotland,This was disturbing but in the non fiction wayLowkey I was sniffing out gay allegations in the first half‚Ä¶. That did stop after a few events tho.This poor doctor just wanted a career and he was helping so many people until he decided to work for the president. This movie also had nothing to do with Scotland but was also inspired by true events.So sorry to any doctor that had to go through thatOther than that I love the Ugandan accents and culture except for the invisible shirts.

Enemy at the Gates,Honestly you have to just respect the absolute caricature that this movie uses
Enemy at the Gates,"It's kind of interminable for a movie with a handful of terrific setpieces. Ron Perlman's all too brief role is the only memorable character. Ed Harris is also innocent for largely existing in the shootout scenes; all the action isn't just the movie's highlight, it's the only time it's cooking at all.The actual story is pretty dull, like everything with the confusing love triangle and the drip of a character rendered drippier by Joseph Fiennes.

John Wick,John Wick‚Äôs ‚Äúthrow the bad guy over your shoulder and then shoot them in the head‚Äù technique is too overpoweredThey gotta nerf that soon
John Wick,"The good: Keanu Reeves as the Grim Reaper, the dog, the stupefying gunfight sequences, the random cameos form acting legendsThe bad: Dialogue, color grading (dull, drab, lifeless), cinematography (amateur hour)The ugly: the Russian accents. TERRIBLE. SO UNNECESSARY.2.5/5"
John Wick,I can't with these goofy-ass subtitles
John Wick,while getting my nails done watching a dog revenge plot? slay

John Wick,"Most realistic but still fun action movie, one of the few perfect action movies."
The Matrix,"They say no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself..I would argue that had I been blind, my comprehension via braille would've been equally sufficient to grok the narrative's demands, more so than my initial viewing that included all of my senses, including smell."
The Matrix,"absolutely adore the idea, hate the execution."
The Matrix,"Kinda just super weird, maybe I‚Äôm not the target demographic. Lots of iconic scenes"
The Matrix,"God I hate this movie. It‚Äôs painfully bad in its effects (just go with practical effects. They‚Äôll always look better. Like seriously), and the message comes off as just a They Live ripoff. I watched The Matrix once a couple years ago, and never intend on seeing it again."
The Matrix,I think this must be my first time watching since knowing Lana & Lilly Wachowski are trans because the trans agenda‚Ñ¢ really hit me this time!! incredible

The Matrix,As a transwoman I am legally obliged to give this movie a 5 star rating
The Matrix,"Isaac Keanewton with all the gravity he invented, Keanu Erivo w/ the gravity he defied"
The Matrix,"I need to watch this again, got distracted and stopped understanding the plot. Can tell it‚Äôs a well thought out movie tho"
The Matrix,I miss the ps2 game of this what a game
The Matrix,"Not a greatly done film, but I enjoyed it and enjoyed the concept"

The Matrix,he really wanted to flex his moves first
The Matrix,i fear that no matter how many times i watch this movie i will still be the same level of confused LOL but at least keanu reeves is in it.
The Matrix,I need 1999 matrix Keanu Reeves so bad it‚Äôs not even funny anymore
The Matrix,morpheus definitely gives off bisexual vibes
The Matrix,more iconic and culturally significant than good
11 Rebels,"Woo-hoo! A rebel will indeed!I originally planned to watch Japanese romance films this month, but I ended up diving into a movie I‚Äôve been eyeing for quite some time‚Äîand boy, wasn‚Äôt this a treat!11 Rebels explores the vastness of the Boshin War as it follows a group of prisoners who are tasked with holding a vital fortress against the Imperial Army until the Samurai Alliance left the domains of Shibata.As I researched more about the film, I‚Ä¶"
11 Rebels,"Suicide Squad / Rogue One A Star Wars Story set in Bakumatsu-era Japan during the Boshin War.If that sounds awesome to you, you'll love this movie.However, it's a bit too long (around 2 hours 30+ minutes)."
11 Rebels,It‚Äôs like Suicide Squad but better
11 Rebels,"I like this type of movie and once it gets going there are a number of fun plot turns to keep things interesting. Nice variety of action with a bunch of startling gory moments that look good on screen. I would say this is more referential than a classic of the genre, but if you like a shogunate samurai rebels ‚Äòn factions political strategy siege slicing off body parts time this is worth a watch."
11 Rebels,It is a little bit too long but it had some pretty good moments and it is representing a group of individuals that is more deserving of recognition. The writing is good and the ending is quite okay.
11 Rebels,"7 Samurai, 13 Assassins, 11 Rebels. What an awesome Trilogy."
11 Rebels,"""All these days my eyes are appetite for this.This is want exactly what I want in action genre.Feast for those who love old-samurai films.KAZUYA SHIRAISHI- Most important filmmaker in today film industry,Give him right recognition before too late.""BRUTAL, BARBARIC & BEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE IN CINEMA HISTORY"
11 Rebels,"I'm a rebel, the 11th one.11 Rebels is a fairly decent Historical Samurai Action film that has good action spread throughout the movie but it felt like there could've more done to it. With a running time of 2 hrs and 30 minutes, the story is simple and at times felt like a comedy but wished it delve deeper into history and had honestly those cheesy dramatic moments paired with equally dramatic music.The whole last remaining samurai or‚Ä¶"
11 Rebels,"It's like ""Dirty Dozen"", ""Suicide Squad"" or ""Rogue One"", but set in 1869 Japan.It's a bit too long but the ection sequences are good, the characters also and the story is interesting."
11 Rebels,bit overdramatic but ok for action freaks
11 Rebels,"Do yourself a favour if you haven't seen them already and go watch 13 Assassins, Harakiri, the original 47 Ronin or any Kurosawa samurai movie. If you've already seen them just watch them again and save yourself from this insufferable mess."
11 Rebels,"I've been tuned out on Shiraishi for a while, but I like how his grim sensibilities‚Äîwhich are usually plodding (and this does drag some)‚Äîcomplement this goofy 60s script. I particularly appreciated how much danger everyone seemed to be in..."
11 Rebels,"You don't see many films set during the Boshin War, so was pretty excited to see this especially when it was advertised back in November 2024. The plot was the stock standard underdogs trying to defend against all odds, but the action was pretty solid. The campiness made the film fairly endearing, when you have a samurai ride up wearing a fedora and smoking a cigarette, you've got my attention. It's on Netflix at the moment, so solid action film for a quiet night but don't expect anything special."
11 Rebels,It's all over the place but the final arc is the best part.
11 Rebels,"The real suicide squad. In this film the choice on how and why you want to die is brought to the for front. For love, country, brotherhood, a promise, revenge. These are all brought up along with a lot of awesome sword fighting and a lot of blood. If you are a fan of films like 13 assassins you‚Äôll enjoy this."
11 Rebels,"If it keeps Kurosawa‚Äôs flame alive... I‚Äôm all in.The gruesome action is impressively executed, with solid performances across the board. The soundtrack is beautiful, enhancing the film's atmosphere. While the story can be a bit confusing at times and runs a little long, it still manages to keep me engaged.A very pleasant surprise!Note: If Daisuke Tsuji is not available, I'm ready forTaiga Nakanoto take the role ofJin Sakaiin a futureGhost of Tsushimamovie."
11 Rebels,"So. Yeh. Pretty epic. Didn't mind it at all, just think unnecessary repetition added too many mins.A long way to go, for that bittersweet ending.Still trying to formulate thoughts, butt both butt & brain are slightly numb..."
Top Gun,Young Tom cruise is my forever crush
Top Gun,I'm surprised at how good the flight scenes hold up compared to the sequel. Can't say the same about the human drama though.
Top Gun,Only watched for Ice Man lowkey üôàüòç
Top Gun,Baby Rooster is so cute im gonna explode
Top Gun,"HIGHWAY TO THE DANGERZONE!I don‚Äôt have much to say on this, it was a good film but I think my expectations were high for this one as I know a lot of people have this rated highly, I liked it a lot but I didn‚Äôt love it! The characters were great especially Maverick and Goose who carried the film for me‚Ä¶ but I did enjoy the flying sequences as they provided some tense moments and some amusing ones (looking‚Ä¶"
Top Gun,Tom cruise is just in his underwear in one of the more emotional scenes in this movieWhy don‚Äôt films take swings like that anymore!!
Top Gun,It‚Äôs a crime that Maverick and Iceman didn‚Äôt open mouth kiss at the end.
Top Gun,This proves that men are gay like I couldn‚Äôt with this movie and I‚Äôm a young female literally every man‚Äôs favorite film CAUSE THEY GAY
Top Gun,"So insanely gay, but when Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer are involved then why not"
Top Gun,One of the gayest shit I‚Äôve seen. Love how take my breath away was played like 4 times in 20 minutes tho.

Top Gun,one big hell yeah and two notes:1. why do bad things happen to silly geese2. once you notice Tom Cruise‚Äôs monobrow you cannot unnotice (trust me)
Top Gun,i loved the part where nothing bad happened and everyone was fine
Top Gun,"Great plot, and the audio-description was very beneficial."
Top Gun,Rhett (Goose) and Link (Maverick) fly planes!
Top Gun,"i re watched because 1. val kilmer and 2. are people on tiktok making up the gay in this movie. they most definitely are not maverick and iceman are up each others asses the whole movie i think i watched this on mute with my eyes closed the first time because i somehow didn‚Äôt see it. i don‚Äôt think i understand enough pilot lingo to really get into this movie though, like i get the vibe and everything and its‚Ä¶"
Top Gun,"A fascistic, fantastic masterpiece nearly as grand and sensual as ‚ÄúTriumph of the Will‚Äù but instead of 3rd Reich euphoria the fever dream here captures Reagan America‚Äôs strangely wounded, impotent Cold War rage and anxiety, along with what has to be the most visceral latent homoeroticism of any contemporary blockbuster. From the married-couple dynamic of the pilots and navigators on, it‚Äôs just relentless. These Navy guys are a good looking bunch - starting with Val Kilmer at peak beauty and‚Ä¶"
