Top Gun,highest,"This film is certainly one of the most iconic of the 80s! Top Gun is without a doubt an adventure full of emotions. In this film we have a show of acting and among the most notable were: Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, both are rivals throughout the story, but in the end they become friends and one recognizes their talent. Maverick's love interest (Cruise) is well shown and developed and sometimes with some small arguments. I recommend this film‚Ä¶",Positive,film certainly one iconic top gun without doubt adventure full emotions film show acting among notable tom cruise val kilmer rivals throughout story end become friends one recognizes talent mavericks love interest cruise well shown developed sometimes small arguments recommend film
